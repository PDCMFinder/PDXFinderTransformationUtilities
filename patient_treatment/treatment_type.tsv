http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/NCIT_C11252	Eniluracil/5-FU Combination Tablet	"A combination tablet of ethynyluracil and fluorouracil. Fluorouracil is an antimetabolite fluoropyrimidine analog of the nucleoside pyrimidine with antineoplastic activity. Ethynyluracil is an orally-active fluoropyrimidine analog that inhibits dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase, the rate-limiting enzyme that catabolizes and inactivates 5-fluorouracil in the liver. This may lead to an increase in the bioavailability and, effectiveness of fluorouracil."	Targeted therapy	Eniluracil/5-FU Combination Tablet	5-FU
http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/NCIT_C62785	5-Fluoro-2-Deoxycytidine	"An antimetabolite consisting of a fluorinated pyrimidine analog with potential antineoplastic activity. As a prodrug, 5-fluoro-2-deoxycytidine is converted by intracellular deaminases to the cytotoxic agent 5-Fluorouracil (5-FU). 5-FU is subsequently metabolized to active metabolites including 5-fluoro-2-deoxyuridine monophosphate (FdUMP) and 5-fluorouridine triphosphate (FUTP). FdUMP binds to and inhibits thymidylate synthase, thereby reducing the production of thymidine monophosphate, which leads to depletion of thymidine triphosphate. This inhibits DNA synthesis and cell division. FUTP competes with uridine triphosphate for incorporation into the RNA strand thus leading to an inhibition of RNA and protein synthesis. Other fluorouracil metabolites also get incorporated into both DNA and RNA, thereby further hampering cellular growth."	Chemotherapy	5-Fluoro-2-Deoxycytidine	5-Fluoro-2-Deoxycytidine

http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/NCIT_C91725	Adavosertib	"A small molecule inhibitor of the tyrosine kinase WEE1 with potential antineoplastic sensitizing activity. Adavosertib selectively targets and inhibits WEE1, a tyrosine kinase that phosphorylates cyclin-dependent kinase 1 (CDK1, CDC2) to inactivate the CDC2/cyclin B complex. Inhibition of WEE1 activity prevents the phosphorylation of CDC2 and impairs the G2 DNA damage checkpoint. This may lead to apoptosis upon treatment with DNA damaging chemotherapeutic agents. Unlike normal cells, most p53 deficient or mutated human cancers lack the G1 checkpoint as p53 is the key regulator of the G1 checkpoint and these cells rely on the G2 checkpoint for DNA repair to damaged cells. Annulment of the G2 checkpoint may therefore make p53 deficient tumor cells more vulnerable to antineoplastic agents and enhance their cytotoxic effect."	Targeted therapy	Adavosertib	Adavosertib

http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/NCIT_C106250	Atezolizumab	"A humanized, Fc optimized, monoclonal antibody directed against the protein ligand PD-L1 (programmed cell death-1 ligand 1; CD274), with potential immune checkpoint inhibitory and antineoplastic activities. Atezolizumab binds to PD-L1, blocking its binding to and activation of its receptor programmed death 1 (PD-1; PDCD1) expressed on activated T-cells, which may enhance the T-cell-mediated immune response to neoplasms and reverse T-cell inactivation. In addition, by binding to PD-L1, atezolizumab also prevents binding of this ligand to B7.1 (CD80) expressed on activated T cells, which further enhances the T-cell-mediated immune response. PD-L1 is overexpressed on many human cancer cell types and on various tumor-infiltrating immune cells. PD-L1 binding to PD-1 on T-cells suppresses the immune system and results in increased immune evasion. PD-1, a transmembrane protein, is a negative regulator of the immune system that limits the expansion and survival of CD8+ T cells. The Fc region of atezolizumab is modified in such a way that it does not induce either antibody-dependent cytotoxicity (ADCC) or complement-dependent cytotoxicity (CDC)."

Upon administration, CBL0137 binds to FACT and sequesters the FACT complex on chromatin, which inhibits its activity. This prevents transcription of certain genes involved in cancer-associated signaling pathways; it specifically inhibits the transcription of both NF-kappa B and heat shock transcription factor 1 (HSF1) and simultaneously activates p53. This causes an increase in tumor cell apoptosis and a decrease in tumor cell proliferation, in FACT-positive cancers. In addition, this agent is able to sensitize FACT-positive tumor cells to the cytotoxic effects of other chemotherapeutic agents. FACT, a transcription and replication factor composed of the Structure Specific Recognition Protein (SSRP1) and suppressor of Ty 16 (Spt16) proteins, is expressed in a variety of tumor cells while almost absent in normal cells; its expression is associated with increased tumor aggressiveness and poor prognosis."

Upon intratumoral injection, talimogene laherparepvec selectively infects and replicates in tumor cells, thereby inducing tumor cell lysis. In addition, GM-CSF attracts dendritic cells (DCs) and may stimulate a cytotoxic T cell response against tumor cells, which results in immune-mediated tumor cell death. Deletion of the gene encoding for ICP34.5 provides tumor selectivity and prevents replication in healthy cells. As ICP47 blocks antigen presentation in HSV-infected cells, deletion of this gene may induce a more potent antitumor immune response in the tumor cells. Additionally, deletion of ICP47 causes increased expression of the HSV US11 gene and allows US11 to be expressed as an immediate early and not a late gene. This further enhances the degree of viral replication and oncolysis of tumor cells."	Immunotherapy	Talimogene Laherparepvec	Talimogene Laherparepvec
