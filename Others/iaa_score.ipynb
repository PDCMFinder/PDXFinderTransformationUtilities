       "['There remains an unmet need for preclinical models to enable personalized therapy for ovarian cancer (OC) patients. Here we evaluate the capacity of patient-derived organoids (PDOs) to predict clinical drug response and functional consequences of tumor heterogeneity. We included 36 whole-genome-characterized PDOs from 23 OC patients with known clinical histories. OC PDOs maintain the genomic features of the original tumor lesion and recapitulate patient response to neoadjuvant carboplatin/paclitaxel combination treatment. PDOs display inter- and intrapatient drug response heterogeneity to chemotherapy and targeted drugs, which can be partially explained by genetic aberrations. PDO drug screening identifies high responsiveness to at least one drug for 88% of patients. PDOs are valuable preclinical models that can provide insights into drug response for individual patients with OC, complementary to genetic testing. Generating PDOs of multiple tumor locations can improve clinical decision making and increase our knowledge of genetic and drug response heterogeneity.',\n",
       " 'Endocrine therapies targeting estrogen signaling have significantly improved breast cancer (BC) patient survival, although 40% of ERŒ±-positive BCs do not respond to those therapies. Aside from genomic signaling, estrogen triggers non-genomic pathways by forming a complex containing methylERŒ±/Src/PI3K, a hallmark of aggressiveness and resistance to tamoxifen. We aimed to confirm the prognostic value of this complex and investigated whether its targeting could improve tumor response in vivo.The interaction of ERŒ±/Src and ERŒ±/PI3K was studied by proximity ligation assay (PLA) in a cohort of 440 BC patients. We then treated patient-derived BC xenografts (PDXs) with fulvestrant or the PI3K inhibitor alpelisib (BYL719) alone or in combination. We analyzed their anti-proliferative effects on 6 ERŒ±+ and 3 ERŒ±- PDX models. Genomic and non-genomic estrogen signaling were assessed by measuring ERŒ±/PI3K interaction by PLA and the expression of estrogen target genes by RT-QPCR, respectively.We confirmed that ERŒ±/Src and ERŒ±/PI3K interactions were associated with a trend to poorer survival, the latter displaying the most significant effects. In ERŒ±+ tumors, the combination of BYL719 and fulvestrant was more effective than fulvestrant alone in 3 models, irrespective of PI3K, PTEN status, or ERŒ±/PI3K targeting. Remarkably, resistance to fulvestrant was associated with non-genomic ERŒ± signaling, since genomic degradation of ERŒ± was unaltered in these tumors, whereas the treatment did not diminish the level of ERŒ±/PI3K interaction. Interestingly, in 2 ERŒ±- models, fulvestrant alone impacted tumor growth, and this was associated with a decrease in ERŒ±/PI3K interaction.Our results demonstrate that ERŒ±/PI3K may constitute a new prognostic marker, as well as a new target in BC. Indeed, resistance to fulvestrant in ERŒ±+ tumors was associated with a lack of impairment of ERŒ±/PI3K interaction in the cytoplasm. In addition, an efficient targeting of ERŒ±/PI3K in ERŒ±- tumors could constitute a promising therapeutic option.',\n",
       " 'Purpose: Response to standard oncologic treatment is limited in colorectal cancer. The gene expression-based consensus molecular subtypes (CMS) provide a new paradigm for stratified treatment and drug repurposing; however, drug discovery is currently limited by the lack of translation of CMS to preclinical models.Experimental Design: We analyzed CMS in primary colorectal cancers, cell lines, and patient-derived xenografts (PDX). For classification of preclinical models, we developed an optimized classifier enriched for cancer cell-intrinsic gene expression signals, and performed high-throughput in vitro drug screening (n = 459 drugs) to analyze subtype-specific drug sensitivities.Results: The distinct molecular and clinicopathologic characteristics of each CMS group were validated in a single-hospital series of 409 primary colorectal cancers. The new, cancer cell-adapted classifier was found to perform well in primary tumors, and applied to a panel of 148 cell lines and 32 PDXs, these colorectal cancer models were shown to recapitulate the biology of the CMS groups. Drug screening of 33 cell lines demonstrated subtype-dependent response profiles, confirming strong response to EGFR and HER2 inhibitors in the CMS2 epithelial/canonical group, and revealing strong sensitivity to HSP90 inhibitors in cells with the CMS1 microsatellite instability/immune and CMS4 mesenchymal phenotypes. This association was validated in vitro in additional CMS-predicted cell lines. Combination treatment with 5-fluorouracil and luminespib showed potential to alleviate chemoresistance in a CMS4 PDX model, an effect not seen in a chemosensitive CMS2 PDX model.Conclusions: We provide translation of CMS classification to preclinical models and uncover a potential for targeted treatment repurposing in the chemoresistant CMS4 group.

       " \"Neuroblastoma is a pediatric cancer of the developing sympathoadrenal lineage. The tumors are known to develop from the adrenal gland or paraspinal ganglia and have molecular and cellular features of sympathetic neurons such as dense core vesicles and catecholamine production. Here we present the detailed molecular, cellular, genetic and epigenetic characterization of an orthotopic xenograft derived from a high-risk stage 4 neuroblastoma patient. Overall, the xenografted tumor retained the high risk features of the primary tumor and showed aggressive growth and metastasis in the mouse. Also, the genome was preserved with no additional copy number variations, structural variations or aneuploidy. There were 13 missense mutations identified in the xenograft that were not present in the patient's primary tumor and there were no new nonsense mutations. None of the missense mutations acquired in the xenograft were in known cancer genes. We also demonstrate the feasibility of using the orthotopic neuroblastoma xenograft to test standard of care chemotherapy and molecular targeted therapeutics. Finally, we optimized a new approach to produce primary cultures of the neuroblastoma xenografts for high-throughput drug screening which can be used to test new combinations of therapeutic agents for neuroblastoma.\",\n",
       " \"Paediatric solid tumours arise from endodermal, ectodermal, or mesodermal lineages. Although the overall survival of children with solid tumours is 75%, that of children with recurrent disease is below 30%. To capture the complexity and diversity of paediatric solid tumours and establish new models of recurrent disease, here we develop a protocol to produce orthotopic patient-derived xenografts at diagnosis, recurrence, and autopsy. Tumour specimens were received from 168 patients, and 67 orthotopic patient-derived xenografts were established for 12 types of cancer. The origins of the patient-derived xenograft tumours were reflected in their gene-expression profiles and epigenomes. Genomic profiling of the tumours, including detailed clonal analysis, was performed to determine whether the clonal population in the xenograft recapitulated the patient's tumour. We identified several drug vulnerabilities and showed that the combination of a WEE1 inhibitor (AZD1775), irinotecan, and vincristine can lead to complete response in multiple rhabdomyosarcoma orthotopic patient-derived xenografts tumours in vivo.\",\n",
       " 'CKIŒ± ablation induces p53 activation, and CKIŒ± degradation underlies the therapeutic effect of lenalidomide in a pre-leukemia syndrome. Here we describe the development of CKIŒ± inhibitors, which co-target the transcriptional kinases CDK7 and CDK9, thereby augmenting CKIŒ±-induced p53 activation and its anti-leukemic activity. Oncogene-driving super-enhancers (SEs) are highly sensitive to CDK7/9 inhibition. We identified multiple newly gained SEs in primary mouse acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cells and demonstrate that the inhibitors abolish many SEs and preferentially suppress the transcription elongation of SE-driven oncogenes. We show that blocking CKIŒ± together with CDK7 and/or CDK9 synergistically stabilize p53, deprive leukemia cells of survival and proliferation-maintaining SE-driven oncogenes, and induce apoptosis. Leukemia progenitors are selectively eliminated by the inhibitors, explaining their therapeutic efficacy with preserved hematopoiesis and leukemia cure potential; they eradicate leukemia in MLL-AF9 and Tet2-/-;Flt3ITD AML mouse models and in several patient-derived AML xenograft models, supporting their potential efficacy in curing human leukemia.',\n",
       " \"Dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans (DFSP) is a rare and indolent cutaneous sarcoma, with the risk of aggressive fibro-sarcomatous transformation. Limited effective options are available for un-resectable or metastatic DFSP beyond targeting the oncogenic PDGF pathway with imatinib therapy. We established a patient-derived xenograft (PDX) and cell line model (designated MDFSP-S1) of imatinib-resistant DFSP with fibro-sarcomatous transformation. Whole genome sequencing identified high-level amplification at chromosomes 17 and 22, whilst homozygous deep deletion was demonstrated at chromosome 9 (CDKN2A, CDKN2B, MTAP). RNA sequencing followed by Sanger sequencing confirmed the pathognomonic COL1A1-PDGFB t (17;22) rearrangement in the original tumour, PDX and cell line model. Immunohistochemistry profiles of the PDX model were consistent with the patient's tumour sample (CD34‚Äâ+‚Äâ/MIB1‚Äâ+‚Äâ/SOX10-‚Äâ). Gene set enrichment analysis highlighted top-scoring Hallmark gene sets in several oncogenic signalling pathways, including potentially targetable MTORC1 signalling and angiogenesis pathways. Antiangiogenic agents (sunitinib, regorafenib, pazopanib, axitinib) and the third-generation irreversible epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) tyrosine kinase inhibitor osimertinib exhibited modest anti-proliferative activity in the cell line, with IC50 values between 1 and 10¬†¬µM at 72¬†h. No significant activity was observed with imatinib, palbociclib, everolimus, olaparib, gefitinib and erlotinib (IC50 all‚Äâ>‚Äâ10¬†¬µM). In conclusion, we established MDFSP-S1, a new PDX and cell line model of imatinib-resistant DFSP with fibro-sarcomatous transformation.\",\n",
       " 'Although BRAF inhibitor monotherapy yields response rates >50% in BRAFV600-mutant melanoma, only approximately 5% of patients with BRAFV600E colorectal cancer respond. Preclinical studies suggest that the lack of efficacy in BRAFV600E colorectal cancer is due to adaptive feedback reactivation of MAPK signaling, often mediated by EGFR. This clinical trial evaluated BRAF and EGFR inhibition with dabrafenib (D) + panitumumab (P) ¬± MEK inhibition with trametinib (T) to achieve greater MAPK suppression and improved efficacy in 142 patients with BRAFV600E colorectal cancer. Confirmed response rates for D+P, D+T+P, and T+P were 10%, 21%, and 0%, respectively. Pharmacodynamic analysis of paired pretreatment and on-treatment biopsies found that efficacy of D+T+P correlated with increased MAPK suppression. Serial cell-free DNA analysis revealed additional correlates of response and emergence of KRAS and NRAS mutations on disease progression. Thus, targeting adaptive feedback pathways in BRAFV600E colorectal cancer can improve efficacy, but MAPK reactivation remains an important primary and acquired resistance mechanism.Significance: This trial demonstrates that combined BRAF + EGFR + MEK inhibition is tolerable, with promising activity in patients with BRAFV600E colorectal cancer. Our findings highlight the MAPK pathway as a critical target in BRAFV600E colorectal cancer and the need to optimize strategies inhibiting this pathway to overcome both primary and acquired resistance.

       " 'Gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine carcinoma (GEP-NEC) is a poorly understood disease with limited treatment options. A better understanding of this disease would greatly benefit from the availability of representative preclinical models. Here, we present the potential of tumor organoids, three-dimensional cultures of tumor cells, to model GEP-NEC. We established three GEP-NEC organoid lines, originating from the stomach and colon, and characterized them using DNA sequencing and immunohistochemistry. Organoids largely resembled the original tumor in expression of synaptophysin, chromogranin and Ki-67. Models derived from tumors containing both neuroendocrine and non-neuroendocrine components were at risk of overgrowth by non-neuroendocrine tumor cells. Organoids were derived from patients treated with cisplatin and everolimus and for the three patients studied, organoid chemosensitivity paralleled clinical response. We demonstrate the feasibility of establishing NEC organoid lines and their potential applications. Organoid culture has the potential to greatly extend the repertoire of preclinical models for GEP-NEC, supporting drug development for this difficult-to-treat tumor type.',\n",
       " \"Standard therapy of osteosarcoma (OS) and Ewing sarcoma (EW) rests on cytotoxic regimes, which are largely unsuccessful in advanced patients. Preclinical models are needed to break this impasse. A panel of patient-derived xenografts (PDX) was established by implantation of fresh, surgically resected osteosarcoma (OS) and Ewing sarcoma (EW) in NSG mice. Engraftment was obtained in 22 of 61 OS (36%) and 7 of 29 EW (24%). The success rate in establishing primary cell cultures from OS was lower than the percentage of PDX engraftment in mice, whereas the reverse was observed for EW; the implementation of both in vivo and in vitro seeding increased the proportion of patients yielding at least one workable model. The establishment of in vitro cultures from PDX was highly efficient in both tumor types, reaching 100% for EW. Morphological and immunohistochemical (SATB2, P-glycoprotein 1, CD99, caveolin 1) studies and gene expression profiling showed a remarkable similarity between patient's tumor and PDX, which was maintained over several passages in mice, whereas cell cultures displayed a lower correlation with human samples. Genes differentially expressed between OS original tumor and PDX mostly belonged to leuykocyte-specific pathways, as human infiltrate is gradually replaced by murine leukocytes during growth in mice. In EW, which contained scant infiltrates, no gene was differentially expressed between the original tumor and the PDX. A novel therapeutic combination of anti-CD99 diabody C7 and irinotecan was tested against two EW PDX; both drugs inhibited PDX growth, the addition of anti-CD99 was beneficial when chemotherapy alone was less effective. The panel of OS and EW PDX faithfully mirrored morphologic and genetic features of bone sarcomas, representing reliable models to test therapeutic approaches.\",\n",
       " 'Heterozygous mutations in NADP-dependent isocitrate dehydrogenases (IDH) define the large majority of diffuse gliomas and are associated with hypermethylation of DNA and chromatin. The metabolic dysregulations imposed by these mutations, whether dependent or not on the oncometabolite D-2-hydroxyglutarate (D2HG), are less well understood. Here, we applied mass spectrometry imaging on intracranial patient-derived xenografts of IDH-mutant versus IDH wild-type glioma to profile the distribution of metabolites at high anatomical resolution in¬†situ This approach was complemented by in¬†vivo tracing of labeled nutrients followed by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) analysis. Selected metabolites were verified on clinical specimen. Our data identify remarkable differences in the phospholipid composition of gliomas harboring the IDH1 mutation. Moreover, we show that these tumors are characterized by reduced glucose turnover and a lower energy potential, correlating with their reduced aggressivity. Despite these differences, our data also show that D2HG overproduction does not result in a global aberration of the central carbon metabolism, indicating strong adaptive mechanisms at hand. Intriguingly, D2HG shows no quantitatively important glucose-derived label in IDH-mutant tumors, which suggests that the synthesis of this oncometabolite may rely on alternative carbon sources. Despite a reduction in NADPH, glutathione levels are maintained. We found that genes coding for key enzymes in de novo glutathione synthesis are highly expressed in IDH-mutant gliomas and the expression of cystathionine-Œ≤-synthase (CBS) correlates with patient survival in the oligodendroglial subtype. This study provides a detailed and clinically relevant insight into the in¬†vivo metabolism of IDH1-mutant gliomas and points to novel metabolic vulnerabilities in these tumors.',\n",
       " 'Nucleophosmin (NPM1) is among the most frequently mutated genes in acute myeloid leukemia (AML). It is not known, however, how the resulting oncoprotein mutant NPM1 is leukemogenic. To reveal the cellular machinery in which NPM1 participates in myeloid cells, we analyzed the endogenous NPM1 protein interactome by mass spectrometry and discovered abundant amounts of the master transcription factor driver of monocyte lineage differentiation PU.1 (also known as SPI1). Mutant NPM1, which aberrantly accumulates in cytoplasm, dislocated PU.1 into cytoplasm with it. CEBPA and RUNX1, the master transcription factors that collaborate with PU.1 to activate granulomonocytic lineage fates, remained nuclear; but without PU.1, their coregulator interactions were toggled from coactivators to corepressors, repressing instead of activating more than 500 granulocyte and monocyte terminal differentiation genes. An inhibitor of nuclear export, selinexor, by locking mutant NPM1/PU.1 in the nucleus, activated terminal monocytic fates. Direct depletion of the corepressor DNA methyltransferase 1 (DNMT1) from the CEBPA/RUNX1 protein interactome using the clinical drug decitabine activated terminal granulocytic fates. Together, these noncytotoxic treatments extended survival by more than 160 days versus vehicle in a patient-derived xenotransplant model of NPM1/FLT3-mutated AML. In sum, mutant NPM1 represses monocyte and granulocyte terminal differentiation by disrupting PU.1/CEBPA/RUNX1 collaboration, a transforming action that can be reversed by pharmacodynamically directed dosing of clinical small molecules.',\n",
       " \"Significant rational is available for specific targeting of PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway in the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). However, almost all clinical trials that have evaluated Pi3K pathway-based monotherapies/combinations did not observe an improvement of patient's outcome. The aim of our study was therefore to define combination of treatment based on the determination of predictive markers of resistance to the mTORC1 inhibitor RAD001/Everolimus. An in vivo study showed high efficacy of RAD001 in NSCLC Patient-Derived Xenografts (PDXs). When looking at biomarkers of resistance by RT-PCR study, three genes were found to be highly expressed in resistant tumors, i.e., PLK1, CXCR4, and AXL. We have then focused our study on the combination of RAD001 + Volasertib, a PLK1 inhibitor, and observed a high antitumor activity of the combination in comparison to each monotherapy; similarly, a clear synergistic effect between the two compounds was found in an in vitro study. Pharmacodynamics study demonstrated that this synergy was due to (1) tumor vascularization decrease, increase of the HIF1 protein expression and decrease of the intracellular pH, and (2) decrease of the Carbonic Anhydrase 9 (CAIX) protein that could not correct intracellular acidosis. In conclusion, all these preclinical data strongly suggest that the inhibition of mTORC1 and PLK1 proteins may be a promising therapeutic approach for NSCLC patients.\",\n",
       " 'The benefit of EGFR-TKI in non-small cell lung cancer has been demonstrated in mutant EGFR tumors as first-line treatment but the benefit in wild-type EGFR tumors is marginal as well as restricted to maintenance therapy in pretreated patients. This work aimed at questioning the effects of cisplatin initial treatment on the EGFR pathway in non-small cell lung cancer and the functional consequences in vitro and in in vivo animal models of patient-derived xenografts (PDX). We establish here that cisplatin pretreatment specifically sensitizes wild-type EGFR-expressing cells to erlotinib, contrary to what happens in mutant EGFR cells and with a blocking EGFR antibody, both in vitro and in vivo The sensitization entails the activation of the kinase Src upstream of EGFR, thereafter transactivating EGFR through a ligand-independent activation. We propose a combination of markers that enable to discriminate between the tumors sensitized to erlotinib or not in PDX models, which should be worth testing in patients. These markers might be useful for the selection of patients who would benefit from erlotinib as a maintenance therapy. Mol Cancer Ther; 16(8); 1634-44. ¬©2017 AACR.',\n",

As preclinical models such as CC cell lines are extremely rare, this manuscript reports a protocol of cholangiocarcinoma patient-derived organoid culture as well as a protocol for the transition of 3D organoid lines to 2D cell lines. Tissue samples of non-cancer bile duct and cholangiocarcinoma were obtained during surgical resection. Organoid lines were generated following a standardized protocol. 2D cell lines were generated from established organoid lines following a novel protocol. Subcutaneous and orthotopic patient-derived xenografts were generated from CC organoid lines, histologically examined, and treated using standard CC protocols. Therapeutic responses of organoids and 2D cell lines were examined using standard CC agents. Next-generation exome and RNA sequencing was performed on primary tumors and CC organoid lines. Patient-derived organoids closely recapitulated the original features of the primary tumors on multiple levels. Treatment experiments demonstrated that patient-derived organoids of cholangiocarcinoma and organoid-derived xenografts can be used for the evaluation of novel treatments and may therefore be used in personalized oncology approaches. In summary, this study establishes cholangiocarcinoma organoids and organoid-derived cell lines, thus expanding translational research resources of cholangiocarcinoma.',\n",
       " 'While BRAF inhibitor combinations with EGFR and/or MEK inhibitors have improved clinical efficacy in BRAFV600E colorectal cancer (CRC), response rates remain low and lack durability. Preclinical data suggest that BRAF/MAPK pathway inhibition may augment the tumor immune response. We performed a proof-of-concept single-arm phase 2 clinical trial of combined PD-1, BRAF and MEK inhibition with sparatlizumab (PDR001), dabrafenib and trametinib in 37 patients with BRAFV600E CRC. The primary end point was overall response rate, and the secondary end points were progression-free survival, disease control rate, duration of response and overall survival. The study met its primary end point with a confirmed response rate (24.3% in all patients; 25% in microsatellite stable patients) and durability that were favorable relative to historical controls of BRAF-targeted combinations alone. Single-cell RNA sequencing of 23 paired pretreatment and day 15 on-treatment tumor biopsies revealed greater induction of tumor cell-intrinsic immune programs and more complete MAPK inhibition in patients with better clinical outcome. Immune program induction in matched patient-derived organoids correlated with the degree of MAPK inhibition. These data suggest a potential tumor cell-intrinsic mechanism of cooperativity between MAPK inhibition and immune response, warranting further clinical evaluation of optimized targeted and immune combinations in CRC.

With these PDXs, we performed in vivo compound screens using a 1 √ó 1 √ó 1 experimental design (PDX clinical trial or PCT) to assess the population responses to 62 treatments across six indications. We demonstrate both the reproducibility and the clinical translatability of this approach by identifying associations between a genotype and drug response, and established mechanisms of resistance. In addition, our results suggest that PCTs may represent a more accurate approach than cell line models for assessing the clinical potential of some therapeutic modalities. We therefore propose that this experimental paradigm could potentially improve preclinical evaluation of treatment modalities and enhance our ability to predict clinical trial responses.',\n",
       " 'Gallbladder carcinoma (GBC) is a relatively rare but highly aggressive cancer with late clinical detection and a poor prognosis. However, the lack of models with features consistent with human gallbladder tumours has hindered progress in pathogenic mechanisms and therapies.We established organoid lines derived from human GBC as well as normal gallbladder and benign gallbladder adenoma (GBA) tissues. The histopathology signatures of organoid cultures were identified by H&E staining, immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence. The genetic and transcriptional features of organoids were analysed by whole-exome sequencing and RNA sequencing. A set of compounds targeting the most active signalling pathways in GBCs were screened for their ability to suppress GBC organoids. The antitumour effects of candidate compounds, CUDC-101 and CUDC-907, were evaluated in vitro and in vivo.The established organoids were cultured stably for more than 6 months and closely recapitulated the histopathology, genetic and transcriptional features, and intratumour heterogeneity of the primary tissues at the single-cell level. Notably, expression profiling analysis of the organoids revealed a set of genes that varied across the three subtypes and thus may participate in the malignant progression of gallbladder diseases. More importantly, we found that the dual PI3K/HDAC inhibitor CUDC-907 significantly restrained the growth of various GBC organoids with minimal toxicity to normal gallbladder organoids.Patient-derived organoids are potentially a useful platform to explore molecular pathogenesis of gallbladder tumours and discover personalized drugs.',\n",
       " 'Patients with biliary tract cancer (BTC) show different responses to chemotherapy, and there is no effective way to predict chemotherapeutic response. We have generated 61 BTC patient-derived organoids (PDOs) from 82 tumors (74.4%) that show similar histological and genetic characteristics to the corresponding primary BTC tissues. BTC tumor tissues with enhanced stemness- and proliferation-related gene expression by RNA sequencing can more easily form organoids. As expected, BTC PDOs show different responses to the chemotherapies of gemcitabine, cisplatin, 5-fluoruracil, oxaliplatin, etc. The drug screening results in PDOs are further validated in PDO-based xenografts and confirmed in 92.3% (12/13) of BTC patients with actual clinical response. Moreover, we have identified gene expression signatures of BTC PDOs with different drug responses and established gene expression panels to predict chemotherapy response in BTC patients. In conclusion, BTC PDO is a promising precision medicine tool for anti-cancer therapy in BTC patients.',\n",
       " 'Patient-derived organoids (PDOs) are widely heralded as a drug-screening platform to develop new anti-cancer therapies. Here, we use a drug-repurposing library to screen PDOs of colorectal cancer (CRC) to identify hidden vulnerabilities within therapy-induced phenotypes. Using a microscopy-based screen that accurately scores drug-induced cell killing, we have tested 414 putative anti-cancer drugs for their ability to switch the EGFRi/MEKi-induced cytostatic phenotype toward cytotoxicity. A majority of validated hits (9/37) are microtubule-targeting agents that are commonly used in clinical oncology, such as taxanes and vinca-alkaloids. One of these drugs, vinorelbine, is consistently effective across a panel of >25 different CRC PDOs, independent of RAS mutational status. Unlike vinorelbine alone, its combination with EGFR/MEK inhibition induces apoptosis at all stages of the cell cycle and shows tolerability and effective anti-tumor activity in¬†vivo, setting the basis for a clinical trial to treat patients with metastatic RAS-mutant CRC.',\n",
       " 'Most breast cancers at an advanced stage exhibit an aggressive nature, and there is a lack of effective anticancer options. Herein, the development of patient-derived organoids (PDOs) is described as a real-time platform to explore the feasibility of tailored treatment for refractory breast cancers. PDOs are successfully generated from breast cancer tissues, including heavily treated specimens. The microtubule-targeting drug-sensitive response signatures of PDOs predict improved distant relapse-free survival for invasive breast cancers treated with adjuvant chemotherapy. It is further demonstrated that PDO pharmaco-phenotyping reflects the previous treatment responses of the corresponding patients. Finally, as clinical case studies, all patients who receive at least one drug predicate to be sensitive by PDOs achieve good responses. Altogether, the PDO model is developed as an effective platform for evaluating patient-specific drug sensitivity in vitro, which can guide personal treatment decisions for breast cancer patients at terminal stage.',\n",

Strategies based on tumor-derived organoids are a powerful tool to assess drug sensitivity at an individual level and to suggest new treatment options or re-challenge. Here, we evaluated the method's feasibility and clinical outcome as applied to patients with no satisfactory treatment options.In this phase 2, single-center, open-label, non-comparative study (ClinicalTrials.gov, register NCT03251612), we enrolled 90 patients with metastatic colorectal cancer following progression on or after standard therapy. Participants were 18 years or older with an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0-2, adequate organ function, and metastasis available for biopsy. Biopsies from the metastatic site were cultured using organoids model. Sensitivity testing was performed with a panel of drugs with proven activity in phase II or III trials. At the discretion of the investigator considering toxicity, the drug with the highest relative activity was offered. The primary endpoint was the proportion of patients alive without disease progression at two months per local assessment.Biopsies available from 82 to 90 patients were processed for cell culture, of which 44 successfully generated organoids with at least one treatment suggested. The precision cohort of 34 patients started treatment and the primary endpoint, progression-free survival (PFS) at two months was met in 17 patients (50%, 95% CI 32-68), exceeding the pre-defined level (14 of 45; 31%). The median PFS was 67 days (95% CI 51-108), and the median overall survival was 189 days (95% CI 103-277).Patient-derived organoids and in-vitro sensitivity testing were feasible in a cohort of metastatic colorectal cancer.

       " 'Hypoxia is negatively associated with glioblastoma (GBM) patient survival and contributes to tumour resistance. Anti-angiogenic therapy in GBM further increases hypoxia and activates survival pathways. The aim of this study was to determine the role of hypoxia-induced autophagy in GBM.Pharmacological inhibition of autophagy was applied in combination with bevacizumab in GBM patient-derived xenografts (PDXs). Sensitivity towards inhibitors was further tested in vitro under normoxia and hypoxia, followed by transcriptomic analysis. Genetic interference was done using ATG9A-depleted cells.We find that GBM cells activate autophagy as a survival mechanism to hypoxia, although basic autophagy appears active under normoxic conditions. Although single agent chloroquine treatment in vivo significantly increased survival of PDXs, the combination with bevacizumab resulted in a synergistic effect at low non-effective chloroquine dose. ATG9A was consistently induced by hypoxia, and silencing of ATG9A led to decreased proliferation in vitro and delayed tumour growth in vivo. Hypoxia-induced activation of autophagy was compromised upon ATG9A depletion.This work shows that inhibition of autophagy is a promising strategy against GBM and identifies ATG9 as a novel target in hypoxia-induced autophagy. Combination with hypoxia-inducing agents may provide benefit by allowing to decrease the effective dose of autophagy inhibitors.',\n",

Phenotypic and genotypic profiling of PDOs showed a high degree of similarity to the original patient tumors. Molecular profiling of tumor organoids was matched to drug-screening results, suggesting that PDOs could complement existing approaches in defining cancer vulnerabilities and improving treatment responses.

There is an unmet need to develop novel clinically relevant models of NSCLC to accelerate identification of drug targets and our understanding of the disease.Thirty surgically resected NSCLC primary patient tissue and 35 previously established patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models were processed for organoid culture establishment. Organoids were histologically and molecularly characterized by cytology and histology, exome sequencing, and RNA-sequencing analysis. Tumorigenicity was assessed through subcutaneous injection of organoids in NOD/SCID mice. Organoids were subjected to drug testing using EGFR, FGFR, and MEK-targeted therapies.We have identified cell culture conditions favoring the establishment of short-term and long-term expansion of NSCLC organoids derived from primary lung patient and PDX tumor tissue. The NSCLC organoids recapitulated the histology of the patient and PDX tumor. They also retained tumorigenicity, as evidenced by cytologic features of malignancy, xenograft formation, preservation of mutations, copy number aberrations, and gene expression profiles between the organoid and matched parental tumor tissue by whole-exome and RNA sequencing. NSCLC organoid models also preserved the sensitivity of the matched parental tumor to targeted therapeutics, and could be used to validate or discover biomarker-drug combinations.Our panel of NSCLC organoids closely recapitulates the genomics and biology of patient tumors, and is a potential platform for drug testing and biomarker validation.',\n",

We used a patient-derived tumor xenograft (PDX) model containing an EGFR exon 19 deletion/T790M mutation to assess response to the EGFR-directed antibody cetuximab. Changes in the EGFR signaling pathway and ligand expression after treatment were investigated.PDX were randomized into control and treatment arms. Pharmacodynamic studies were performed at 2 and 24 hours and at 4 days after a single administration of cetuximab, erlotinib, or dacomitinib. Changes in the EGFR signaling pathway were assessed using Western blot analysis, and baseline mRNA expression of EGFR ligands using microarray analysis. Relative changes after treatment were assessed using quantitative polymerase chain reaction.The xenograft showed a dramatic response to cetuximab. A complete reduction of total EGFR and phosphorylated EGFR occurred after cetuximab treatment. The PDX had increased baseline levels of heparin-binding epidermal growth factor-like growth factor (HB-EGF) compared with other PDX models with or without EGFR mutations. Amphiregulin was significantly reduced 2 hours after treatment with cetuximab. Compared with control mice, cetuximab- and EGFR-TKI-treated mice had significantly reduced HB-EGF gene expression at 2 hours, however, by day 4 the level of HB-EGF expression was higher. The effect of cetuximab compared with EGFR TKI on HB-EGF gene expression levels differed significantly at 2 and 24 hours but not at 4 days.We showed a dramatic tumor response with cetuximab in an exon 19 deletion/T790M EGFR mutant lung adenocarcinoma PDX model, which suggests a role for the autocrine feedback loop in the mutant EGFR signaling pathway.

       " 'T cell bispecific antibodies (TCBs) are engineered molecules that include, within a single entity, binding sites to the T cell receptor and to tumor-associated or tumor-specific antigens. The receptor tyrosine kinase HER2 is a tumor-associated antigen in ~25% of breast cancers. TCBs targeting HER2 may result in severe toxicities, likely due to the expression of HER2 in normal epithelia. About 40% of HER2-positive tumors express p95HER2, a carboxyl-terminal fragment of HER2. Using specific antibodies, here, we show that p95HER2 is not expressed in normal tissues. We describe the development of p95HER2-TCB and show that it has a potent antitumor effect on p95HER2-expressing breast primary cancers and brain lesions. In contrast with a TCB targeting HER2, p95HER2-TCB has no effect on nontransformed cells that do not overexpress HER2. These data pave the way for the safe treatment of a subgroup of HER2-positive tumors by targeting a tumor-specific antigen.',\n",
       " 'Objective: Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) inhibition may be effective in biomarker-selected populations of advanced gastro-oesophageal adenocarcinoma (aGEA) patients. Here, we tested the association between outcome and EGFR copy number (CN) in pretreatment tissue and plasma cell-free DNA (cfDNA) of patients enrolled in a randomised first-line phase III clinical trial of chemotherapy or chemotherapy plus the anti-EGFR monoclonal antibody panitumumab in aGEA (NCT00824785). Design: EGFR CN by either fluorescence in situ hybridisation (n=114) or digital-droplet PCR in tissues (n=250) and plasma cfDNAs (n=354) was available for 474 (86%) patients in the intention-to-treat (ITT) population. Tissue and plasma low-pass whole-genome sequencing was used to screen for coamplifications in receptor tyrosine kinases. Interaction between chemotherapy and EGFR inhibitors was modelled in patient-derived organoids (PDOs) from aGEA patients. Results: EGFR amplification in cfDNA correlated with poor survival in the ITT population and similar trends were observed when the analysis was conducted in tissue and plasma by treatment arm. EGFR inhibition in combination with chemotherapy did not correlate with improved survival, even in patients with significant EGFR CN gains. Addition of anti-EGFR inhibitors to the chemotherapy agent epirubicin in PDOs, resulted in a paradoxical increase in viability and accelerated progression through the cell cycle, associated with p21 and cyclin B1 downregulation and cyclin E1 upregulation, selectively in organoids from EGFR-amplified aGEA. Conclusion: EGFR CN can be accurately measured in tissue and liquid biopsies and may be used for the selection of aGEA patients. EGFR inhibitors may antagonise the antitumour effect of anthracyclines with important implications for the design of future combinatorial trials.',\n",

Selective estrogen receptor degraders (SERD) are being developed as a strategy to more effectively target ER and exploit ER dependence in these cancers, which includes inhibiting both wild-type and mutant forms of ER. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of a novel orally bioavailable SERD, elacestrant (RAD1901), in preclinical models of ER+ breast cancer.Experimental Design: Elacestrant was evaluated as a single agent and in combination with palbociclib or everolimus in multiple ER+ breast cancer models, including several patient-derived xenograft models.Results: Elacestrant induces the degradation of ER, inhibits ER-mediated signaling and growth of ER+ breast cancer cell lines in vitro and in vivo, and significantly inhibits tumor growth of multiple PDX models. Furthermore, we demonstrate that elacestrant in combination with palbociclib or everolimus can lead to greater efficacy in certain contexts. Finally, elacestrant exhibits significant antitumor activity both as a single agent and in combination with palbociclib in two patient-derived breast cancer xenograft models harboring ESR1 mutations.Conclusions: These data underscore the potential clinical utility of elacestrant as a single agent and as a combination therapy, for both early- and late-stage ER+ disease.

       " \"Glioblastomas are incurable tumors infiltrating the brain. A subpopulation of glioblastoma cells forms a functional and therapy-resistant tumor cell network interconnected by tumor microtubes (TMs). Other subpopulations appear unconnected, and their biological role remains unclear. Here, we demonstrate that whole-brain colonization is fueled by glioblastoma cells that lack connections with other tumor cells and astrocytes yet receive synaptic input from neurons. This subpopulation corresponds to neuronal and neural-progenitor-like tumor cell states, as defined by single-cell transcriptomics, both in mouse models and in the human disease. Tumor cell invasion resembled neuronal migration mechanisms and adopted a L√©vy-like movement pattern of probing the environment. Neuronal activity induced complex calcium signals in glioblastoma cells followed by the de novo formation of TMs and increased invasion speed. Collectively, superimposing molecular and functional single-cell data revealed that neuronal mechanisms govern glioblastoma cell invasion on multiple levels. This explains how glioblastoma's dissemination and cellular heterogeneity are closely interlinked.\",\n",

In the PDX model, pyrotinib showed a superior antitumor effect than afatinib (P‚Äâ=‚Äâ0.0471) and T-DM1 (P‚Äâ=‚Äâ0.0138). Mice treated with pyrotinib displayed significant tumor burden reduction (mean tumor volume, -52.2%). In contrast, afatinib (25.4%) and T-DM1 (10.9%) showed no obvious reduction. Moreover, pyrotinib showed a robust ability to inhibit pHER2, pERK and pAkt. In the phase II cohort of 15 patients with HER2-mutant NSCLC, pyrotinib 400‚Äâmg resulted in a objective response rate of 53.3% and a median progression-free survival of 6.4‚Äâmonths.Pyrotinib showed activity against NSCLC with HER2 exon 20 mutations in both patient-derived organoids and a PDX model. In the clinical trial, pyrotinib showed promising efficacy.NCT02535507.',\n",
       " \"M√ºllerian inhibiting substance, also called anti-M√ºllerian hormone (AMH), inhibits proliferation and induces apoptosis of AMH type II receptor-positive tumor cells, such as human ovarian cancers (OCs). On this basis, a humanized glyco-engineered monoclonal antibody (3C23K) has been developed. The aim of this study was therefore to experimentally confirm the therapeutic potential of 3C23K in human OCs. We first determined by immunofluorescence, immunohistochemistry and cytofluorometry analyses the expression of AMHRII in patient's tumors and found that a majority (60 to 80% depending on the detection technique) of OCs were positive for this marker. We then provided evidence that the tumor stroma of OC is enriched in tumor-associated macrophages and that these cells are responsible for 3C23K-induced killing of tumor cells through ADCP and ADCC mechanisms. In addition, we showed that 3C23K reduced macrophages induced-T cells immunosuppression. Finally, we evaluated the therapeutic efficacy of 3C23K alone and in combination with a carboplatin-paclitaxel chemotherapy in a panel of OC Patient-Derived Xenografts. In those experiments, we showed that 3C23K significantly increased the proportion and the quality of chemotherapy-based in vivo responses. Altogether, our data support the potential interest of AMHRII targeting in human ovarian cancers and the evaluation of 3C23K in further clinical trials.\",\n",
       " 'To evaluate if patient-derived organoids (PDOs) may predict response to neoadjuvant (NAT) chemotherapy in patients with pancreatic adenocarcinoma.PDOs have been explored as a biomarker of therapy response and for personalized therapeutics in patients with pancreatic cancer.During 2017-2021, patients were enrolled into an IRB-approved protocol and PDO cultures were established. PDOs of interest were analyzed through a translational pipeline incorporating molecular profiling and drug sensitivity testing.One hundred thirty-six samples, including both surgical resections and fine needle aspiration/biopsy from 117 patients with pancreatic cancer were collected. This biobank included diversity in stage, sex, age, and race, with minority populations representing 1/3 of collected cases (16% Black, 9% Asian, 7% Hispanic/Latino). Among surgical specimens, PDO generation was successful in 71% (15 of 21) of patients who had received NAT prior to sample collection and in 76% (39 of 51) of patients who were untreated with chemotherapy or radiation at the time of collection. Pathological response to NAT correlated with PDO chemotherapy response, particularly oxaliplatin. We demonstrated the feasibility of a rapid PDO drug screen and generated data within 7 days of tissue resection.Herein we report a large single-institution organoid biobank, including ethnic minority samples. The ability to establish PDOs from chemotherapy-naive and post-NAT tissue enables longitudinal PDO generation to assess dynamic chemotherapy sensitivity profiling. PDOs can be rapidly screened and further development of rapid screening may aid in the initial stratification of patients to the most active NAT regimen.',\n",
       " 'Resistance to oxaliplatin is a major obstacle for the management of locally advanced and metastatic colon cancer (CC). Although long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) play key roles in CC, the relationships between lncRNAs and resistance to oxaliplatin have been poorly understood yet.Chemo-sensitive and chemo-resistant organoids were established from colon cancer tissues of the oxaliplatin-sensitive or -resistant patients. Analysis of the patient cohort indicated that lnc-RP11-536‚ÄâK7.3 had a potential oncogenic role in CC. Further, a series of functional in vitro and in vivo experiments were conducted to assess the effects of lnc-RP11-536‚ÄâK7.3 on CC proliferation, glycolysis, and angiogenesis. RNA pull-down assay, luciferase reporter and fluorescent in situ hybridization assays were used to confirm the interactions between lnc-RP11-536‚ÄâK7.3, SOX2 and their downstream target HIF-1Œ±.In this study, we identified a novel lncRNA, lnc-RP11-536‚ÄâK7.3, was associated with resistance to oxaliplatin and predicted a poor survival. Knockout of lnc-RP11-536‚ÄâK7.3 inhibited the proliferation, glycolysis, and angiogenesis, whereas enhanced chemosensitivity in chemo-resistant organoids and CC cells both in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, we found that lnc-RP11-536‚ÄâK7.3 recruited SOX2 to transcriptionally activate USP7 mRNA expression. The accumulative USP7 resulted in deubiquitylation and stabilization of HIF-1Œ±, thereby facilitating resistance to oxaliplatin.In conclusion, our findings indicated that lnc-RP11-536‚ÄâK7.3 could promote proliferation, glycolysis, angiogenesis, and chemo-resistance in CC by SOX2/USP7/HIF-1Œ± signaling axis. This revealed a new insight into how lncRNA could regulate chemosensitivity and provide a potential therapeutic target for reversing resistance to oxaliplatin in the management of CC.',\n",
       " 'Lung cancer shows substantial genetic and phenotypic heterogeneity across individuals, driving a need for personalised medicine. Here, we report lung cancer organoids and normal bronchial organoids established from patient tissues comprising five histological subtypes of lung cancer and non-neoplastic bronchial mucosa as in vitro models representing individual patient. The lung cancer organoids recapitulate the tissue architecture of the primary lung tumours and maintain the genomic alterations of the original tumours during long-term expansion in vitro. The normal bronchial organoids maintain cellular components of normal bronchial mucosa. Lung cancer organoids respond to drugs based on their genomic alterations: a BRCA2-mutant organoid to olaparib, an EGFR-mutant organoid to erlotinib, and an EGFR-mutant/MET-amplified organoid to crizotinib. Considering the short length of time from organoid establishment to drug testing, our newly developed model may prove useful for predicting patient-specific drug responses through in vitro patient-specific drug trials.',\n",
       " 'Embryonal rhabdomyosarcoma (eRMS) is one of the most common soft tissue sarcomas in children and adolescents. Parameningeal eRMS is a variant that is often more difficult to treat than eRMS occurring at other sites. A 14-year-old female with persistent headaches and rapid weight loss was diagnosed with parameningeal eRMS. She progressed and died despite chemotherapy with vincristine, actinomycin-D, and cyclophosphamide plus 50.4‚ÄâGy radiation therapy to the primary tumor site. Tumor specimens were acquired by rapid autopsy and tumor tissue was transplanted into immunodeficient mice to create a patient-derived xenograft (PDX) animal model. As autopsy specimens had an ALK R1181C mutation, PDX tumor bearing animals were treated with the pan-kinase inhibitor lestaurtinib but demonstrated no decrease in tumor growth, suggesting that single agent kinase inhibitor therapy may be insufficient in similar cases. This unique parameningeal eRMS PDX model is publicly available for preclinical study.',\n",

With current therapies, 70% of patients with localized disease survive, but patients with metastatic or recurrent disease have a poor outcome. We found that EWS cell lines are defective in DNA break repair and are sensitive to PARP inhibitors (PARPis). PARPi-induced cytotoxicity in EWS cells was 10- to 1,000-fold higher after administration of the DNA-damaging agents irinotecan or temozolomide. We developed an orthotopic EWS mouse model and performed pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic studies using three different PARPis that are in clinical development for pediatric cancer. Irinotecan administered on a low-dose, protracted schedule previously optimized for pediatric patients was an effective DNA-damaging agent when combined with PARPis; it was also better tolerated than combinations with temozolomide. Combining PARPis with irinotecan and temozolomide gave complete and durable responses in more than 80% of the mice.',\n",
       " 'Triple negative breast cancers (TNBCs) represent 15-20% of all breast cancers and are associated with higher recurrence and distant metastasis rate. Standard of care for early stage TNBC is anthracyclines combined with cyclophosphamide (AC) followed by taxanes, in the neo-adjuvant or adjuvant setting. This work aimed to identify predictive biomarkers of AC response in patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models of TNBC and to validate them in the clinical setting. By gene and protein expression analysis of 39 PDX with different responses to AC, we found that high expression of HORMAD1 was associated with better response to AC. Both gene and protein expression were associated with promoter hypomethylation. In a cohort of 526 breast cancer patients, HORMAD1 was overexpressed in 71% of TNBC. In a second cohort of 186 TNBC patients treated with AC, HORMAD1 expression was associated with longer metastasis-free survival (MFS). In summary, HORMAD1 overexpression was predictive of an improved response to AC in PDX and is an independent prognostic factor in TNBC patients treated with AC.',\n",
       " \"Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) has the worst prognosis among solid malignancies and improved therapeutic strategies are needed to improve outcomes. Patient-derived xenografts (PDX) and patient-derived organoids (PDO) serve as promising tools to identify new drugs with therapeutic potential in PDAC. For these preclinical disease models to be effective, they should both recapitulate the molecular heterogeneity of PDAC and validate patient-specific therapeutic sensitivities. To date however, deep characterization of the molecular heterogeneity of PDAC PDX and PDO models and comparison with matched human tumour remains largely unaddressed at the whole genome level. We conducted a comprehensive assessment of the genetic landscape of 16 whole-genome pairs of tumours and matched PDX, from primary PDAC and liver metastasis, including a unique cohort of 5 'trios' of matched primary tumour, PDX, and PDO. We developed a pipeline to score concordance between PDAC models and their paired human tumours for genomic events, including mutations, structural variations, and copy number variations. Tumour-model comparisons of mutations displayed single-gene concordance across major PDAC driver genes, but relatively poor agreement across the greater mutational load. Genome-wide and chromosome-centric analysis of structural variation (SV) events highlights previously unrecognized concordance across chromosomes that demonstrate clustered SV events. We found that polyploidy presented a major challenge when assessing copy number changes; however, ploidy-corrected copy number states suggest good agreement between donor-model pairs. Collectively, our investigations highlight that while PDXs and PDOs may serve as tractable and transplantable systems for probing the molecular properties of PDAC, these models may best serve selective analyses across different levels of genomic complexity.\",\n",

However, the agent and regimen are not clearly defined. Worldwide, less than 15% of patients receive this adjuvant chemotherapeutic instillation. We recently developed a pipeline for the generation of patient derived organoids (PDO) in NMIBC. In this phase II trial, we aim to use our in vitro pipeline to select the most effective drug for chemotherapeutic instillation in NMIBC patients.Patients with first diagnosis of intermediate-risk NMIBC that are directed to transurethral resection of bladder tumor (TURBT) are enrolled. During TURBT, tumor is sampled, and specimens are directed to generate PDO. Once the PDO are formed, drug screens on them for Epirubicin, Mitomycin C, Gemcitabine and Docetaxel are performed. The drug with the highest antitumor activity in vitro will then be selected for 6 adjuvant intravesical instillations once weekly. Thereafter, patients are followed according to clinical guidelines by cystoscopy.The aim of this trial is to use drug screens in PDO to precise treatment selection for adjuvant instillation therapies in patients with intermediate-risk NMIBC. The ultimate goal of this trial is to reduce the risk of cancer recurrence. In the future, we aim to conduct clinical multicenter trials with an increased sample size, a broader panel of compounds and a focus on the reduction of cancer recurrence by precision delivery of care.

We describe an androgen-dependent PCa patient-derived xenograft (PDX) model from treatment-na√Øve, soft tissue metastasis (PNPCa). RNA and whole-exome sequencing of the PDX tissue and organoids confirmed transcriptomic and genomic similarity to primary tumor. PNPCa harbors BRCA2 and CHD1 somatic mutations, shows an SPOP/FOXA1-like transcriptomic signature and microsatellite instability, which occurs in 3% of advanced PCa and has never been modeled in vivo. Comparison of the treatment-na√Øve PNPCa with additional metastatic PDXs (BM18, LAPC9), in a medium-throughput organoid screen of FDA-approved compounds, revealed differential drug sensitivities. Multikinase inhibitors (ponatinib, sunitinib, sorafenib) were broadly effective on all PDX- and patient-derived organoids from advanced cases with acquired resistance to standard-of-care compounds. This proof-of-principle study may provide a preclinical tool to screen drug responses to standard-of-care and newly identified, repurposed compounds.',\n",

Head and neck cancer (HNC) is a collective term used for multiple tumor types including squamous cell carcinomas and salivary gland adenocarcinomas.Organoids were established from HNC patient tumor tissue and characterized using immunohistochemistry and DNA sequencing. Organoids were exposed to chemo- and radiotherapy and a panel of targeted agents. Organoid response was correlated with patient clinical response. CRISPR-Cas9-based gene editing of organoids was applied for biomarker validation.A HNC biobank consisting of 110 models, including 65 tumor models, was generated. Organoids retained DNA alterations found in HNC. Comparison of organoid and patient response to radiotherapy (primary [n¬†= 6] and adjuvant [n¬†= 15]) indicated potential for guiding treatment options in the adjuvant setting. In organoids, the radio-sensitizing potential of cisplatin and carboplatin could be validated. However, cetuximab conveyed radioprotection in most models. HNC-targeted treatments were tested on 31 models, indicating possible novel treatment options with the potential for treatment stratification in the future. Activating PIK3CA mutations did not predict alpelisib response in organoids. Protein arginine methyltransferase 5 (PRMT5) inhibitors were identified as a potential treatment option for cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 2A (CDKN2A) null HNC.Organoids hold potential as a diagnostic tool in personalized medicine for HNC. In¬†vitro organoid response to radiotherapy (RT) showed a trend that mimics clinical response, indicating the predictive potential of patient-derived organoids.

       " 'Targeting tumor-overexpressed EGFR with an antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) is an attractive therapeutic strategy; however, normal tissue expression represents a significant toxicity risk. The anti-EGFR antibody ABT-806 targets a unique tumor-specific epitope and exhibits minimal reactivity to EGFR in normal tissue, suggesting its suitability for the development of an ADC. We describe the binding properties and preclinical activity of ABT-414, an ABT-806 monomethyl auristatin F conjugate. In vitro, ABT-414 selectively kills tumor cells overexpressing wild-type or mutant forms of EGFR. ABT-414 inhibits the growth of xenograft tumors with high EGFR expression and causes complete regressions and cures in the most sensitive models. Tumor growth inhibition is also observed in tumor models with EGFR mutations, including activating mutations and those with the exon 2-7 deletion [EGFR variant III (EGFRvIII)], commonly found in glioblastoma multiforme. ABT-414 exhibits potent cytotoxicity against glioblastoma multiforme patient-derived xenograft models expressing either wild-type EGFR or EGFRvIII, with sustained regressions and cures observed at clinically relevant doses. ABT-414 also combines with standard-of-care treatment of radiation and temozolomide, providing significant therapeutic benefit in a glioblastoma multiforme xenograft model. On the basis of these results, ABT-414 has advanced to phase I/II clinical trials, and objective responses have been observed in patients with both amplified wild-type and EGFRvIII-expressing tumors.

       " 'The high frequency of homologous recombination deficiency (HRD) is the main rationale of testing platinum-based chemotherapy in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), however, the existing methods to identify HRD are controversial and there is a medical need for predictive biomarkers. We assess the in vivo response to platinum agents in 55 patient-derived xenografts (PDX) of TNBC to identify determinants of response. The HRD status, determined from whole genome sequencing, is highly predictive of platinum response. BRCA1 promoter methylation is not associated with response, in part due to residual BRCA1 gene expression and homologous recombination proficiency in different tumours showing mono-allelic methylation. Finally, in 2 cisplatin sensitive tumours we identify mutations in XRCC3 and ORC1 genes that are functionally validated in vitro. In conclusion, our results demonstrate that the genomic HRD is predictive of platinum response in a large cohort of TNBC PDX and identify alterations in XRCC3 and ORC1 genes driving cisplatin response.',\n",

It is being increasingly recognised that the immune system plays an essential role in LS tumour development, thus making an ideal target for cancer prevention. Our objective was to evaluate the safety, assess the activity and discover novel molecular pathways involved in the activity of naproxen as primary and secondary chemoprevention in patients with LS.We conducted a Phase Ib, placebo-controlled, randomised clinical trial of two dose levels of naproxen sodium (440 and 220‚Äâmg) administered daily for 6 months to 80 participants with LS, and a co-clinical trial using a genetically engineered mouse model of LS and patient-derived organoids (PDOs).Overall, the total number of adverse events was not different across treatment arms with excellent tolerance of the intervention. The level of prostaglandin E2 in the colorectal mucosa was significantly decreased after treatment with naproxen when compared with placebo. Naproxen activated different resident immune cell types without any increase in lymphoid cellularity, and changed the expression patterns of the intestinal crypt towards epithelial differentiation and stem cell regulation. Naproxen demonstrated robust chemopreventive activity in a mouse co-clinical trial and gene expression profiles induced by naproxen in humans showed perfect discrimination of mice specimens with LS and PDOs treated with naproxen and control.Naproxen is a promising strategy for immune interception in LS.

       " 'Luminal androgen receptor (LAR) breast cancer accounts for 10% of all triple-negative breast cancers (TNBC). Anti-androgen therapy for this subtype is in development, but yields only partial clinical benefits. In this study, we aimed to characterize the genomic alterations of LAR TNBC, to analyze activation of the PI3K signaling pathway and to compare the response to PI3K pathway inhibitors with that to anti-androgen therapy in patient-derived xenografts (PDX) of LAR TNBC. Methods: Four LAR PDX models were identified, on the basis of their transcriptomic profiles, in a cohort of 57 PDX models of TNBC. The expression of AR-related genes, basal and luminal cytokeratins and EMT genes was analyzed by RT-PCR and IHC. AKT1 and PIK3CA mutations were identified by targeted NGS, and activation of the PI3K pathway was analyzed with a reverse-phase protein array. Three LAR PDXs with a PIK3CA or AKT1 mutation were treated with the AR inhibitor enzalutamide, a PI3K inhibitor, a dual PI3K-mTOR inhibitor and a mTORC1-mTORC2 inhibitor. Finally, we screened a clinical cohort of 329 TNBC for PIK3CA and AKT1 hotspot mutations. Results: LAR TNBC PDXs were significantly enriched in PIK3CA and AKT1 mutations, and had higher levels of luminal-androgen-like gene expression and a higher PI3K pathway protein activation score than other TNBC subtypes. Immunohistochemistry analysis revealed strong expression of the luminal cytokeratin CK18 and AR in three LAR PDX models. We found that mTOR and PI3K inhibitors had marked antitumor activity in vivo in PDX harboring genomic alterations of PIK3CA and AKT1 genes that did not respond to the AR antagonist enzalutamide. PIK3CA mutations were detected in more than one third of AR+ TNBC from patients (38%), and only 10% of AR-negative TNBC. Conclusion: Our results for PDX models of LAR TNBC resistant to enzalutamide indicate that PIK3CA and AKT1 are potential therapeutic targets.',\n",
       " 'The identity and unique capacity of cancer stem cells (CSC) to drive tumor growth and resistance have been challenged in brain tumors. Here we report that cells expressing CSC-associated cell membrane markers in Glioblastoma (GBM) do not represent a clonal entity defined by distinct functional properties and transcriptomic profiles, but rather a plastic state that most cancer cells can adopt. We show that phenotypic heterogeneity arises from non-hierarchical, reversible state transitions, instructed by the microenvironment and is¬†predictable by mathematical modeling. Although functional stem cell properties were similar in vitro, accelerated reconstitution of heterogeneity provides a growth advantage in vivo, suggesting that tumorigenic potential is linked to intrinsic plasticity rather than CSC multipotency. The capacity of any given cancer cell to reconstitute tumor heterogeneity cautions against therapies targeting CSC-associated membrane epitopes. Instead inherent cancer cell plasticity emerges as a novel relevant target for treatment.',\n",

       " 'Our increasing knowledge of the mechanisms behind the progression of pancreatic cancer (PC) has not yet translated into effective treatments. Many promising drugs have failed in the clinic, highlighting the need for better preclinical models to assess drug efficacy and characterize mechanisms of resistance. Using different experimental models, including patient-derived xenografts (PDXs), we gauged the efficacy of therapies aimed at two hallmark lesions of PCs: activation of signaling pathways by oncogenic KRAS and inactivation of tumor-suppressor genes. Although the drug targeting inactivation of tumor suppressors by DNA methylation had little effect, the inhibition of Mek, a K-Ras effector, in combination with the standard of care (chemotherapy consisting of gemcitabine/Nab-paclitaxel), reduced the growth of three out of five PC-PDXs and impaired metastasis. The two least responding PC-PDXs were composed of genetically diverse cells, which displayed sensitivities to the Mek inhibitor differing by >10-fold. Unexpectedly, our analysis of this genetic diversity unveiled different KRAS mutations. As mutation in KRAS occurs early during progression, this heterogeneity may reflect the simultaneous appearance of different malignant cellular clones or, alternatively, that cells containing two mutations of KRAS are selected during tumor evolution. In vitro and in vivo analyses indicated that the intratumoral heterogeneity, along with the selective pressure imposed by the Mek inhibitor, resulted in rapid selection of resistant cells. Together with the gemcitabine/Nab-paclitaxel backbone, Mek inhibition could be effective in treatment of PC. However, resistance because of intratumoral heterogeneity is likely to develop frequently, pointing to the necessity of identifying the factors and mechanisms of resistance to further develop this therapy.',\n",

PHLC402 was treated with crizotinib (50 mg/kg) by daily oral gavage.ALK FISH assay was positive in both the primary patient tumor and PDX, which were negative for ALK protein expression by immunohistochemical analysis. ALK fusion product was not detected by RNA sequencing and reverse-transcriptase quantitative polymerase chain reaction comparing the 5' and 3' ALK transcript levels. Crizotinib treatment of PHLC402 grown in mice resulted in no tumor response.ALK protein expression may be necessary for ALK FISH-positive lung cancer to be responsive to ALK inhibitor therapy.\",\n",

Here, we characterized 115 patient-derived mouse-intraductal (MIND) DCIS models reflecting the full spectrum of DCIS observed in patients. Utilizing the possibility to follow the natural progression of DCIS combined with omics and imaging data, we reveal multiple prognostic factors for high-risk DCIS including high grade, HER2 amplification, expansive 3D growth, and high burden of copy number aberrations. In addition, sequential transplantation of xenografts showed minimal phenotypic and genotypic changes over time, indicating that invasive behavior is an intrinsic phenotype of DCIS and supporting a multiclonal evolution model. Moreover, this study provides a collection of 19 distributable DCIS-MIND models spanning all molecular subtypes.',\n",

We established a patient-derived xenograft (PDX) and cell line model (designated MPT-S1) of malignant PT which demonstrated clinical response to pazopanib. Whole exome sequencing identified somatic mutations in TP53, RB1, MED12, and KMT2D. Immunohistochemistry and genomic profiles of the tumor, PDX and cell line were concordant. In keeping with clinical observation, pazopanib reduced cell viability in a dose-dependent manner and evoked apoptosis, and led to significant abrogation of in vivo tumor growth. Whole transcriptomic analysis revealed that pazopanib decreased expression of genes involved in oncogenic and apoptosis signaling. We also observed decreased expression of ENPP1, with known roles in cancer invasion and metastasis, as well as STING pathway upregulation. Accordingly, pazopanib induced micronuclei formation, and evoked phospho-TBK1 and PD-L1 expression. In an additional cohort of malignant PT (n‚Äâ=‚Äâ14), six (42.9%) showed comparable or higher levels of ENPP1 relative to MPT-S1, highlighting its potential role as a therapeutic target. In conclusion, we established MPT-S1, a new PDX and cell line model, and provided evidence for the clinical efficacy of pazopanib in malignant PT.',\n",

       " 'Genomics has greatly improved how patients with cancer are being treated; however, clinical-grade genomic biomarkers for chemotherapies are currently lacking. Using whole-genome analysis of 37 patients with metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) treated with the chemotherapy trifluridine/tipiracil (FTD/TPI), we identified KRAS codon G12 (KRASG12) mutations as a potential biomarker of resistance. Next, we collected real-world data of 960 patients with mCRC receiving FTD/TPI and validated that KRASG12 mutations were significantly associated with poor survival, also in analyses restricted to the RAS/RAF mutant subgroup. We next analyzed the data of the global, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 3 RECOURSE trial (n‚Äâ=‚Äâ800 patients) and found that KRASG12 mutations (n‚Äâ=‚Äâ279) were predictive biomarkers for reduced overall survival (OS) benefit of FTD/TPI versus placebo (unadjusted interaction P‚Äâ=‚Äâ0.0031, adjusted interaction P‚Äâ=‚Äâ0.015). For patients with KRASG12 mutations in the RECOURSE trial, OS was not prolonged with FTD/TPI versus placebo (n‚Äâ=‚Äâ279; hazard ratio (HR)‚Äâ=‚Äâ0.97; 95% confidence interval (CI)‚Äâ=‚Äâ0.73-1.20; P‚Äâ=‚Äâ0.85).

In isogenic cell lines and patient-derived organoids, KRASG12 mutations were associated with increased resistance to FTD-based genotoxicity. In conclusion, these data show that KRASG12 mutations are biomarkers for reduced OS benefit of FTD/TPI treatment, with potential implications for approximately 28% of patients with mCRC under consideration for treatment with FTD/TPI. Furthermore, our data suggest that genomics-based precision medicine may be possible for a subset of chemotherapies.',\n",

The success rate of PDX establishment was associated with tumor histopathology and the cellularity and cytopathological diagnosis of the primary EBUS-TBNA samples.From December 2011 to June 2012, 19 patients were enrolled in this study. Successful engraftment was achieved in 8/19 cases (42.1%). The duration between inoculation and tumor formation averaged 62.4 days (13-144 days). The engrafted tumors included 3 adenocarcinomas (3/12: 25%), 2 squamous cell carcinomas (2/3: 67%), 1 large cell carcinoma (1/1: 100%), and 2 small cell carcinomas (2/3: 67%).EBUS-TBNA samples can be used for establishment of tumor xenograft model in immunodeficient mice.',\n",
       " 'Patient-based cancer models are essential tools for studying tumor biology and for the assessment of drug responses in a translational context. We report the establishment a large cohort of unique organoids and patient-derived orthotopic xenografts (PDOX) of various glioma subtypes, including gliomas with mutations in IDH1, and paired longitudinal PDOX from primary and recurrent tumors of the same patient. We show that glioma PDOXs enable long-term propagation of patient tumors and represent clinically relevant patient avatars that retain histopathological, genetic, epigenetic, and transcriptomic features of parental tumors. We find no evidence of mouse-specific clonal evolution in glioma PDOXs. Our cohort captures individual molecular genotypes for precision medicine including mutations in IDH1, ATRX, TP53, MDM2/4, amplification of EGFR, PDGFRA, MET, CDK4/6, MDM2/4, and deletion of CDKN2A/B, PTCH, and PTEN. Matched longitudinal PDOX recapitulate the limited genetic evolution of gliomas observed in patients following treatment. At the histological level, we observe increased vascularization in the rat host as compared to mice. PDOX-derived standardized glioma organoids are amenable to high-throughput drug screens that can be validated in mice. We show clinically relevant responses to temozolomide (TMZ) and to targeted treatments, such as EGFR and CDK4/6 inhibitors in (epi)genetically defined subgroups, according to MGMT promoter and EGFR/CDK status, respectively. Dianhydrogalactitol (VAL-083), a promising bifunctional alkylating agent in the current clinical trial, displayed high therapeutic efficacy, and was able to overcome TMZ resistance in glioblastoma. Our work underscores the clinical relevance of glioma organoids and PDOX models for translational research and personalized treatment studies and represents a unique publicly available resource for precision oncology.',\n",
       " \"The overarching goal of this project is to establish a patient-derived bladder cancer xenograft (PDX) platform, annotated with deep sequencing and patient clinical information, to accelerate the development of new treatment options for bladder cancer patients. Herein, we describe the creation, initial characterization and use of the platform for this purpose.Twenty-two PDXs with annotated clinical information were established from uncultured unselected clinical bladder cancer specimens in immunodeficient NSG mice. The morphological fidelity was maintained in PDXs. Whole exome sequencing revealed that PDXs and parental patient cancers shared 92-97% of genetic aberrations, including multiple druggable targets. For drug repurposing, an EGFR/HER2 dual inhibitor lapatinib was effective in PDX BL0440 (progression-free survival or PFS of 25.4 days versus 18.4 days in the control, p = 0.007), but not in PDX BL0269 (12 days versus 13 days in the control, p = 0.16) although both expressed HER2. To screen for the most effective MTT, we evaluated three drugs (lapatinib, ponatinib, and BEZ235) matched with aberrations in PDX BL0269; but only a PIK3CA inhibitor BEZ235 was effective (p<0.0001). To study the mechanisms of secondary resistance, a fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 inhibitor BGJ398 prolonged PFS of PDX BL0293 from 9.5 days of the control to 18.5 days (p<0.0001), and serial biopsies revealed that the MAPK/ERK and PIK3CA-AKT pathways were activated upon resistance. Inhibition of these pathways significantly prolonged PFS from 12 day of the control to 22 days (p = 0.001). To screen for effective chemotherapeutic drugs, four of the first six PDXs were sensitive to the cisplatin/gemcitabine combination, and chemoresistance to one drug could be overcome by the other drug.The PDX models described here show good correlation with the patient at the genomic level and known patient response to treatment. This supports further evaluation of the PDXs for their ability to accurately predict a patient's response to new targeted and combination strategies for bladder cancer.\",\n",
       " 'High-grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSOC) remains an unmet medical challenge. Here, we unravel an unanticipated metabolic heterogeneity¬†in¬†HGSOC. By combining proteomic, metabolomic,¬†and bioergenetic analyses, we identify two¬†molecular subgroups, low- and high-OXPHOS. While low-OXPHOS exhibit a glycolytic metabolism, high-OXPHOS HGSOCs rely on oxidative phosphorylation, supported by glutamine and fatty¬†acid oxidation, and show chronic oxidative stress. We identify an important role for the PML-PGC-1Œ± axis in the metabolic features of high-OXPHOS HGSOC. In high-OXPHOS tumors, chronic oxidative stress promotes aggregation of PML-nuclear bodies, resulting in activation of the¬†transcriptional co-activator PGC-1Œ±. Active PGC-1Œ± increases synthesis of electron transport¬†chain complexes, thereby promoting mitochondrial¬†respiration. Importantly, high-OXPHOS HGSOCs exhibit increased response to conventional¬†chemotherapies, in which increased oxidative stress, PML, and potentially ferroptosis play key functions. Collectively, our data establish a stress-mediated PML-PGC-1Œ±-dependent mechanism that promotes OXPHOS metabolism and chemosensitivity in ovarian cancer.',\n",
       " 'Purpose: Uterine sarcomas are rare and heterogeneous tumors characterized by an aggressive clinical behavior. Their high rates of recurrence and mortality point to the urgent need for novel targeted therapies and alternative treatment strategies. However, no molecular prognostic or predictive biomarkers are available so far to guide choice and modality of treatment.Experimental Design: We investigated the expression of several druggable targets (phospho-S6S240 ribosomal protein, PTEN, PDGFR-Œ±, ERBB2, and EGFR) in a large cohort of human uterine sarcoma samples (288), including leiomyosarcomas, low-grade and high-grade endometrial stromal sarcomas, undifferentiated uterine sarcomas, and adenosarcomas, together with 15 smooth muscle tumors of uncertain malignant potential (STUMP), 52 benign uterine stromal tumors, and 41 normal uterine tissues. The potential therapeutic value of the most promising target, p-S6S240, was tested in patient-derived xenograft (PDX) leiomyosarcoma models.Results: In uterine sarcomas and STUMPs, S6S240 phosphorylation (reflecting mTOR pathway activation) was associated with higher grade (P = 0.001) and recurrence (P = 0.019), as shown by logistic regression. In addition, p-S6S240 correlated with shorter progression-free survival (P = 0.034). Treatment with a dual PI3K/mTOR inhibitor significantly reduced tumor growth in 4 of 5 leiomyosarcoma PDX models (with tumor shrinkage in 2 models). Remarkably, the 4 responding models showed basal p-S6S240 expression, whereas the nonresponding model was scored as negative, suggesting a role for p-S6S240 in response prediction to PI3K/mTOR inhibition.Conclusions: Dual PI3K/mTOR inhibition represents an effective therapeutic strategy in uterine leiomyosarcoma, and p-S6S240 expression is a potential predictive biomarker for response to treatment.

       " 'Overall survival remains very poor for patients diagnosed as having head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). Identification of additional biomarkers and novel therapeutic strategies are important for improving patient outcomes. Patient-derived xenografts (PDXs), generated by implanting fresh tumor tissue directly from patients into immunodeficient mice, recapitulate many of the features of their corresponding clinical cancers, including histopathological and molecular profiles. Using a large collection of PDX models of HNSCC, we demonstrate that rapid engraftment into immunocompromised mice is highly prognostic and show that genomic deregulation of the G1/S checkpoint pathway correlates with engraftment. Furthermore, CCND1 and CDKN2A genomic alterations are predictive of response to the CDK4and CDK6 inhibitor abemaciclib. Overall, our study supports the pursuit of CDK4 and CDK6 inhibitors as a therapeutic strategy for a substantial proportion of HNSCC patients and demonstrates the potential of using PDX models to identify targeted therapies that will benefit patients who have the poorest outcomes.',\n",
       " 'Stromal content heavily impacts the transcriptional classification of colorectal cancer (CRC), with clinical and biological implications. Lineage-dependent stromal transcriptional components could therefore dominate over more subtle expression traits inherent to cancer cells. Since in patient-derived xenografts (PDXs) stromal cells of the human tumour are substituted by murine counterparts, here we deploy human-specific expression profiling of CRC PDXs to assess cancer-cell intrinsic transcriptional features. Through this approach, we identify five CRC intrinsic subtypes (CRIS) endowed with distinctive molecular, functional and phenotypic peculiarities: (i) CRIS-A: mucinous, glycolytic, enriched for microsatellite instability or KRAS mutations; (ii) CRIS-B: TGF-Œ≤ pathway activity, epithelial-mesenchymal transition, poor prognosis; (iii) CRIS-C: elevated EGFR signalling, sensitivity to EGFR inhibitors; (iv) CRIS-D: WNT activation, IGF2 gene overexpression and amplification; and (v) CRIS-E: Paneth cell-like phenotype, TP53 mutations. CRIS subtypes successfully categorize independent sets of primary and metastatic CRCs, with limited overlap on existing transcriptional classes and unprecedented predictive and prognostic performances.',\n",
       " \"High-grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSC) is the leading cause of morbidity and mortality from gynecologic malignant tumors. Overall survival remains low because of the nearly ubiquitous emergence of platinum resistance and the paucity of effective next-line treatments. Current cell culture-based models show limited similarity to HGSC and are therefore unreliable predictive models for preclinical evaluation of investigational drugs. This deficiency could help explain the low overall rate of successful drug development and the decades of largely unchanged approaches to HGSC treatment. We used gene expression, copy number variation, and exome sequencing analyses to credential HGSC patient-derived xenografts (PDXs) as effective preclinical models that recapitulate the features of human HGSC. Mice bearing PDXs were also treated with standard-of-care carboplatin therapy. PDXs showed similar sensitivity to carboplatin as the patient's tumor at the time of sampling. PDXs also recapitulated the diversity of genomic alterations (copy number variation and mutation profiles) previously described in large data sets that profiled HGSC. Furthermore, mRNA profiling showed that the PDXs represent all HGSC subtypes with the exception of the immunoreactive group. Credentialing of PDX models of HGSC should aid progress in HGSC research by providing improved preclinical models of HGSC that can be used to test novel targets and more accurately evaluate their likelihood of success.\",\n",
       " 'Oestrogen receptor-negative (ER-) breast cancer is intrinsically sensitive to chemotherapy. However, tumour response is often incomplete, and relapse occurs with high frequency. The aim of this work was to analyse the molecular characteristics of residual tumours and early response to chemotherapy in patient-derived xenografts (PDXs) of breast cancer.Gene and protein expression profiles were analysed in a panel of ER- breast cancer PDXs before and after chemotherapy treatment. Tumour and stromal interferon-gamma expression was measured in xenografts lysates by human and mouse cytokine arrays, respectively.The analysis of residual tumour cells in chemo-responder PDX revealed a strong overexpression of IFN-inducible genes, induced early after AC treatment and associated with increased STAT1 phosphorylation, DNA-damage and apoptosis. No increase in IFN-inducible gene expression was observed in chemo-resistant PDXs upon chemotherapy. Overexpression of IFN-related genes was associated with human IFN-Œ≥ secretion by tumour cells.Treatment-induced activation of the IFN/STAT1 pathway in tumour cells is associated with chemotherapy response in ER- breast cancer. Further validations in prospective clinical trials will aim to evaluate the usefulness of this signature to assist therapeutic strategies in the clinical setting.',\n",
       " 'Kidney cancer is one of the most common solid tumors. The advancement of human kidney cancer research and treatment has been hindered by a lack of research models that faithfully recapitulate the diversity of the disease.We established an effective three-dimensional culture system for generating kidney cancer organoids from clinical renal cell carcinoma samples. Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) organoids were characterized by H&E staining, immunofluorescence, whole-exome sequencing, RNA sequencing and single-cell RNA sequencing. The use of RCC organoids in personalized cancer therapy was assessed by testing their responses to treatment drugs and chimeric antigen receptor T cells.Using this organoid culture system, 33 kidney cancer organoid lines from common kidney cancer subtypes, including clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC), papillary renal cell carcinoma (pRCC), and chromophobe renal cell carcinoma (chRCC), were generated. RCC organoids preserved the histological architectures, mutational landscapes, and transcriptional profile of the parental tumor tissues. Single-cell RNA-sequencing revealed inter- and intra-tumoral heterogeneity in RCC organoids. RCC organoids allowed for in vitro drug screening and provided a tool for assessing the efficacy of chimeric antigen receptor T cells.Patient-derived RCC organoids are valuable pre-clinical models for academic research and personalized medicine.',\n",
       " 'Accumulating evidence indicates that patient-derived organoids (PDOs) can predict drug responses in the clinic, but the ability of PDOs to predict responses to chemoradiation in cancer patients remains an open question. Here we generate a living¬†organoid biobank from patients with locally advanced rectal cancer (LARC) treated with neoadjuvant chemoradiation (NACR) enrolled in a phase III clinical trial. Our co-clinical trial data confirm that rectal cancer organoids (RCOs) closely recapitulate the pathophysiology and genetic changes of corresponding tumors. Chemoradiation responses in patients are highly matched to RCO responses, with 84.43% accuracy, 78.01% sensitivity, and 91.97% specificity. These data imply that PDOs predict LARC patient responses in the clinic and may represent a companion diagnostic tool in rectal cancer treatment.',\n",
       " 'The persistence of cancer cells resistant to therapy remains a major clinical challenge. In triple-negative breast cancer, resistance to chemotherapy results in the highest recurrence risk among breast cancer subtypes. The drug-tolerant state seems largely defined by nongenetic features, but the underlying mechanisms are poorly understood. Here, by monitoring epigenomes, transcriptomes and lineages with single-cell resolution, we show that the repressive histone mark H3K27me3 (trimethylation of histone‚ÄâH3 at lysine‚Äâ27) regulates cell fate at the onset of chemotherapy. We report that a persister expression program is primed with both H3K4me3 (trimethylation of histone‚ÄâH3 at lysine‚Äâ4) and H3K27me3 in unchallenged cells, with H3K27me3 being the lock to its transcriptional activation. We further demonstrate that depleting H3K27me3 enhances the potential of cancer cells to tolerate chemotherapy. Conversely, preventing H3K27me3 demethylation simultaneously to chemotherapy inhibits the transition to a drug-tolerant state, and delays tumor recurrence in vivo. Our results highlight how chromatin landscapes shape the potential of cancer cells to respond to initial therapy.',\n",

We established 23 PDXs from 88 surgical specimens of lung cancer patients and determined gene mutations in these PDXs and their paired primary tumors by ultradeep exome sequencing on 202 cancer-related genes. The numbers of primary tumors with deleterious mutations in TP53, KRAS, PI3KCA, ALK, STK11, and EGFR were 43.5%, 21.7%, 17.4%, 17.4%, 13.0%, and 8.7%, respectively. Other genes with deleterious mutations in ‚â•3 (13.0%) primary tumors were MLL3, SETD2, ATM, ARID1A, CRIPAK, HGF, BAI3, EP300, KDR, PDGRRA and RUNX1. Of 315 mutations detected in the primary tumors, 293 (93%) were also detected in their corresponding PDXs, indicating that PDXs have the capacity to recapitulate the mutations in primary tumors. Nevertheless, a substantial number of mutations had higher allele frequencies in the PDXs than in the primary tumors, or were not detectable in the primary tumor, suggesting the possibility of tumor cell enrichment in PDXs or heterogeneity in the primary tumors. The molecularly annotated PDXs generated from this study could be useful for future translational studies.',\n",

A clinical study of recently diagnosed metastatic colorectal cancer (CRC) patients using an MOS-based precision oncology pipeline reliably assessed tumor drug response within 14¬†days, a timeline suitable for guiding treatment decisions in the clinic.

       " 'Many patients with advanced cancers achieve dramatic responses to a panoply of therapeutics yet retain minimal residual disease (MRD), which ultimately results in relapse. To gain insights into the biology of MRD, we applied single-cell RNA sequencing to malignant cells isolated from BRAF mutant patient-derived xenograft melanoma cohorts exposed to concurrent RAF/MEK-inhibition. We identified distinct drug-tolerant transcriptional states, varying combinations of which co-occurred within MRDs from PDXs and biopsies of patients on treatment. One of these exhibited a neural crest stem cell (NCSC) transcriptional program largely driven by the nuclear receptor RXRG. An RXR antagonist mitigated accumulation of NCSCs in MRD and delayed the development of resistance. These data identify NCSCs as key drivers of resistance and illustrate the therapeutic potential of MRD-directed therapy. They also highlight how gene regulatory network architecture reprogramming may be therapeutically exploited to limit cellular heterogeneity, a key driver of disease progression and therapy resistance.',\n",

We integrated transcriptomic, epigenomic, and proteomic/phosphoproteomic data to elucidate the cellular origins and therapeutic vulnerabilities of rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS). We discovered that alveolar RMS occurs further along the developmental program than embryonal RMS. We also identified deregulation of the RAS/MEK/ERK/CDK4/6, G2/M, and unfolded protein response pathways through our integrated analysis. Comprehensive preclinical testing revealed that targeting the WEE1 kinase in the G2/M pathway is the most effective approach in¬†vivo for high-risk RMS.',\n",

Subsets of PDAC PDX models showed global copy number variants and gene expression profiles that were retained with serial passaging, and they showed a spectrum of somatic mutations represented in patient tumors. PDAC XDO models were established, with a success rate of 71% (10/14). Pathway activation of KRAS-MAPK in PDXs was independent of¬†KRAS¬†mutational status. Four wild-type KRAS models were characterized by one with¬†EGFR¬†(L747-P753 del), two with BRAF alterations (N486_P490del or V600E), and one with triple negative¬†KRAS/EGFR/BRAF.

We developed orthotopic patient-derived xenografts (PDXs) that recapitulated the molecular, cellular and histologic features of primary tumors, and screened PDX-expanded short-term cultures and commercial cell lines of osteosarcoma against focused drug libraries. Osteosarcoma cells were most sensitive to HDAC, proteasome, and combination PI3K/MEK and PI3K/mTOR inhibitors, and least sensitive to PARP, RAF, ERK and MEK inhibitors. Correspondingly, PI3K signaling pathway genes were up-regulated in metastatic tumors compared to primary tumors. In combinatorial screens, as a class, HDAC inhibitors showed additive effects when combined with standard-of-care agents gemcitabine and doxorubicin.

One of the main challenges in investigating bone metastasis in breast cancer is engineering in vitro models that replicate the features of in vivo bone environments. Such in vitro models ideally enable the biology of the metastatic cells to mimic their in vivo behavior as closely as possible. Here, taking benefit of cutting-edge technologies both in microfabrication and cancer cell biology, we have developed an in vitro breast cancer bone-metastasis model. To do so we first 3D printed a bone scaffold that reproduces the trabecular architecture and that can be conditioned with osteoblast-like cells, a collagen matrix, and mineralized calcium. We thus demonstrated that this device offers an adequate soil to seed primary breast cancer bone metastatic cells. In particular, patient-derived xenografts being considered as a better approach than cell lines to achieve clinically relevant results, we demonstrate the ability of this biomimetic bone niche model to host patient-derived xenografted metastatic breast cancer cells. These patient-derived xenograft cells show a long-term survival in the bone model and maintain their cycling propensity, and exhibit the same modulated drug response as in vivo. This experimental system enables access to the idiosyncratic features of the bone microenvironment and cancer bone metastasis, which has implications for drug testing.',\n",
       " 'Topoisomerase I (TOP1) inhibitors trap TOP1 cleavage complexes resulting in DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) during replication, which are repaired by homologous recombination (HR). Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) could be eligible for TOP1 inhibitors given the considerable proportion of tumors with a defect in HR-mediated repair (BRCAness). The TOP1 inhibitor irinotecan was tested in 40 patient-derived xenografts (PDXs) of TNBC. BRCAness was determined with a single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) assay, and expression of Schlafen family member 11 (SLFN11) and retinoblastoma transcriptional corepressor 1 (RB1) was evaluated by real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and immunohistochemistry analyses. In addition, the combination of irinotecan and the ataxia telangiectasia and Rad3-related protein (ATR) inhibitor VE-822 was tested in SLFN11-negative PDXs, and two clinical non-camptothecin TOP1 inhibitors (LMP400 and LMP776) were tested. Thirty-eight percent of the TNBC models responded to irinotecan. BRCAness combined with high SLFN11 expression and RB1 loss identified highly sensitive tumors, consistent with the notion that deficiencies in cell cycle checkpoints and DNA repair result in high sensitivity to TOP1 inhibitors. Treatment by the ATR inhibitor VE-822 increased sensitivity to irinotecan in SLFN11-negative PDXs and abolished irinotecan-induced phosphorylation of checkpoint kinase 1 (CHK1). LMP400 (indotecan) and LMP776 (indimitecan) showed high antitumor activity in BRCA1-mutated or BRCAness-positive PDXs. Last, low SLFN11 expression was associated with poor survival in 250 patients with TNBC treated with anthracycline-based chemotherapy. In conclusion, a substantial proportion of TNBC respond to irinotecan. BRCAness, high SLFN11 expression, and RB1 loss are highly predictive of response to irinotecan and the clinical indenoisoquinoline TOP1 inhibitors.',\n",

RNA sequencing and RPPA (reverse phase protein array) analyses were conducted to decipher molecular features of the two PDXs and define the therapeutic strategy of interest, validated by in vivo drug efficacy examination and in vitro cell proliferation analysis.Results: Estrogen acted as a growth driver of trastuzumab-resistant COH-SC31 tumors but an accelerator in the trastuzumab-sensitive COH-SC1 model. In vivo trastuzumab efficacy examination further confirmed the consistent responses between PDXs and the corresponding tumors. Integrative omics analysis revealed that mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) and ERŒ± signaling predominantly regulate tumor growth of the two HR+/HER2+ PDXs.

Luciferase-based measurement served as a quantitative read-out for target cell viability. Additionally, we set up a confocal live imaging protocol to monitor effector cell recruitment and cytolytic activity at a single organoid level. As proof of principle, we demonstrated efficient targeting in diverse organoid models using CAR-engineered NK-92 cells directed toward a ubiquitous epithelial antigen (EPCAM). Tumor antigen-specific cytotoxicity was studied with CAR-NK-92 cells targeting organoids expressing EGFRvIII, a neoantigen found in several cancers. Finally, we tested a novel CAR strategy targeting FRIZZLED receptors that show increased expression in a subgroup of CRC tumors. Here, comparative killing assays with normal organoids failed to show tumor-specific activity. Taken together, we report a sensitive in¬†vitro platform to evaluate CAR efficacy and tumor specificity in a personalized manner.',\n",
       " 'Background: Breast cancer patients who do not respond to neoadjuvant therapy have a poor prognosis. There is a pressing need for novel targets and models for preclinical testing. Here we report characterization of breast cancer patient-derived xenografts (PDX) largely generated from residual tumors following neoadjuvant chemotherapy.Experimental Design: PDXs were derived from surgical samples of primary or locally recurrent tumors. Normal and tumor DNA sequencing, RNASeq, and reverse phase protein arrays (RPPA) were performed. Phenotypic profiling was performed by determining efficacy of a panel of standard and investigational agents.Results: Twenty-six PDXs were developed from 25 patients. Twenty-two were generated from residual disease following neoadjuvant chemotherapy, and 24 were from triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). These PDXs harbored a heterogeneous set of genomic alterations and represented all TNBC molecular subtypes. On RPPA, PDXs varied in extent of PI3K and MAPK activation. PDXs also varied in their sensitivity to chemotherapeutic agents. PI3K, mTOR, and MEK inhibitors repressed growth but did not cause tumor regression. The PARP inhibitor talazoparib caused dramatic regression in five of 12 PDXs. Notably, four of five talazoparib-sensitive models did not harbor germline BRCA1/2 mutations, but several had somatic alterations in homologous repair pathways, including ATM deletion and BRCA2 alterations.Conclusions: PDXs capture the molecular and phenotypic heterogeneity of TNBC. Here we show that PARP inhibition can have activity beyond germline BRCA1/2 altered tumors, causing regression in a variety of molecular subtypes. These models represent an opportunity for the discovery of rational combinations with targeted therapies and predictive biomarkers. Clin Cancer Res; 23(21); 6468-77. ¬©2017 AACR.',\n",
       " 'Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is the leading cause of cancer deaths worldwide. Only a fraction of NSCLC harbor actionable driver mutations and there is an urgent need for patient-derived model systems that will enable the development of new targeted therapies. NSCLC and other cancers display profound proteome remodeling compared to normal tissue that is not predicted by DNA or RNA analyses. Here, we generate 137 NSCLC patient-derived xenografts (PDXs) that recapitulate the histology and molecular features of primary NSCLC. Proteome analysis of the PDX models reveals 3 adenocarcinoma and 2 squamous cell carcinoma proteotypes that are associated with different patient outcomes, protein-phosphotyrosine profiles, signatures of activated pathways and candidate targets, and in adenocarcinoma, stromal immune features. These findings portend proteome-based NSCLC classification and treatment and support the PDX resource as a viable model for the development of new targeted therapies.',\n",
       " 'Neuroendocrine prostate cancer (NEPC) is an aggressive variant of prostate cancer that may develop de novo or as a mechanism of treatment resistance. N-myc is capable of driving NEPC progression. Alisertib inhibits the interaction between N-myc and its stabilizing factor Aurora-A, inhibiting N-myc signaling, and suppressing tumor growth.Sixty men were treated with alisertib 50 mg twice daily for 7 days every 21 days. Eligibility included metastatic prostate cancer and at least one: small-cell neuroendocrine morphology; ‚â•50% neuroendocrine marker expression; new liver metastases without PSA progression; or elevated serum neuroendocrine markers. The primary endpoint was 6-month radiographic progression-free survival (rPFS). Pretreatment biopsies were evaluated by whole exome and RNA-seq and patient-derived organoids were developed.Median PSA was 1.13 ng/mL (0.01-514.2), number of prior therapies was 3, and 68% had visceral metastases. Genomic alterations involved RB1 (55%), TP53 (46%), PTEN (29%), BRCA2 (29%), and AR (27%), and there was a range of androgen receptor signaling and NEPC marker expression. Six-month rPFS was 13.4% and median overall survival was 9.5 months (7.3-13). Exceptional responders were identified, including complete resolution of liver metastases and prolonged stable disease, with tumors suggestive of N-myc and Aurora-A overactivity. Patient organoids exhibited concordant responses to alisertib and allowed for the dynamic testing of Aurora-N-myc complex disruption.Although the study did not meet its primary endpoint, a subset of patients with advanced prostate cancer and molecular features supporting Aurora-A and N-myc activation achieved significant clinical benefit from single-agent alisertib.',\n",
       " 'Cervical cancer is a common gynecological malignancy often caused by high-risk human papillomavirus. There is a paucity of human-derived culture systems to study the cervical epithelium and the cancers derived thereof. Here we describe a long-term culturing protocol for ecto- and endocervical epithelia that generates 3D organoids that stably recapitulate the two tissues of origin. As evidenced for HSV-1, organoid-based cervical models may serve to study sexually transmitted infections. Starting from Pap brush material, a small biobank of tumoroids derived from affected individuals was established that retained the causative human papillomavirus (HPV) genomes. One of these uniquely carried the poorly characterized HPV30 subtype, implying a potential role in carcinogenesis. The tumoroids displayed differential responses to common chemotherapeutic agents and grew as xenografts in mice. This study describes an experimental platform for cervical (cancer) research and for future personalized medicine approaches.',\n",
       " 'A significant proportion of patients with oestrogen receptor (ER) positive breast cancers (BC) develop resistance to endocrine treatments (ET) and relapse with metastatic disease. Here we perform whole exome sequencing and gene expression analysis of matched primary breast tumours and bone metastasis-derived patient-derived xenografts (PDX). Transcriptomic analyses reveal enrichment of the G2/M checkpoint and up-regulation of Polo-like kinase 1 (PLK1) in PDX. PLK1 inhibition results in tumour shrinkage in highly proliferating CCND1-driven PDX, including different RB-positive PDX with acquired palbociclib resistance. Mechanistic studies in endocrine resistant cell lines, suggest an ER-independent function of PLK1 in regulating cell proliferation. Finally, in two independent clinical cohorts of ER positive BC, we find a strong association between high expression of PLK1 and a shorter metastases-free survival and poor response to anastrozole. In conclusion, our findings support clinical development of PLK1 inhibitors in patients with advanced CCND1-driven BC, including patients progressing on palbociclib treatment.',\n",
       " 'Under conditions of starvation, normal and tumor epithelial cells can rewire their metabolism toward the consumption of extracellular proteins, including extracellular matrix-derived components as nutrient sources. The mechanism of pericellular matrix degradation by starved cells has been largely overlooked. Here it is shown that matrix degradation by breast and pancreatic tumor cells and patient-derived xenograft explants increases by one order of magnitude upon amino acid and growth factor deprivation. In addition, it is found that collagenolysis requires the invadopodia components, TKS5, and the transmembrane metalloproteinase, MT1-MMP, which are key to the tumor invasion program. Increased collagenolysis is controlled by mTOR repression upon nutrient depletion or pharmacological inhibition by rapamycin. The results reveal that starvation hampers clathrin-mediated endocytosis, resulting in MT1-MMP accumulation in arrested clathrin-coated pits. The study uncovers a new mechanism whereby mTOR repression in starved cells leads to the repurposing of abundant plasma membrane clathrin-coated pits into robust ECM-degradative assemblies.',\n",
       " 'EGFR exon 20 insertion driver mutations (Exon20ins) in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) are insensitive to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI). Amivantamab (JNJ-61186372), a bispecific antibody targeting EGFR-MET, has shown preclinical activity in TKI-sensitive EGFR-mutated NSCLC models and in an ongoing first-in-human study in patients with advanced NSCLC. However, the activity of amivantamab in Exon20ins-driven tumors has not yet been described. Ba/F3 cells and patient-derived cells/organoids/xenograft models harboring diverse Exon20ins were used to characterize the antitumor mechanism of amivantamab. Amivantamab inhibited proliferation by effectively downmodulating EGFR-MET levels and inducing immune-directed antitumor activity with increased IFNŒ≥ secretion in various models. Importantly, in vivo efficacy of amivantamab was superior to cetuximab or poziotinib, an experimental Exon20ins-targeted TKI. Amivantamab produced robust tumor responses in two Exon20ins patients, highlighting the important translational nature of this preclinical work. These findings provide mechanistic insight into the activity of amivantamab and support its continued clinical development in Exon20ins patients, an area of high unmet medical need. SIGNIFICANCE: Currently, there are no approved targeted therapies for EGFR Exon20ins-driven NSCLC. Preclinical data shown here, together with promising clinical activity in an ongoing phase I study, strongly support further clinical investigation of amivantamab in EGFR Exon20ins-driven NSCLC.This article is highlighted in the In This Issue feature, p. 1079.',\n",
       " 'Bladder cancer is the fifth most prevalent cancer in the U.S., yet is understudied, and few laboratory models exist that reflect the biology of the human disease. Here, we describe a biobank of patient-derived organoid lines that recapitulates the histopathological and molecular diversity of human bladder cancer. Organoid lines can be established efficiently from patient biopsies acquired before and after disease recurrence and are interconvertible with orthotopic xenografts. Notably, organoid lines often retain parental tumor heterogeneity and exhibit a spectrum of genomic changes that are consistent with tumor evolution in culture. Analyses of drug response using bladder tumor organoids show partial correlations with mutational profiles, as well as changes associated with treatment resistance, and specific responses can be validated using xenografts in¬†vivo. Our studies indicate that patient-derived bladder tumor organoids represent a faithful model system for studying tumor evolution and treatment response in the context of precision cancer medicine.',\n",
       " 'Although epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) -mutated adenocarcinomas initially have high response rates to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), most patients eventually develop resistance. Patient-derived xenografts (PDXs) are considered preferred preclinical models to study the biology of patient tumors. EGFR-mutant PDX models may be valuable tools to study the biology of these tumors and to elucidate mechanisms of resistance to EGFR-targeted therapies.Surgically resected early-stage non-small-cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC) tumors were implanted into nonobese diabetic severe combined immune deficient (NOD-SCID) mice. EGFR TKI treatment was initiated at tumor volumes of 150 ŒºL. Gene expression analysis was performed using a microarray platform.Of 33 lung adenocarcinomas with EGFR activating mutations, only 6 (18%) engrafted and could be propagated beyond passage one. Engraftment was associated with upregulation of genes involved in mitotic checkpoint and cell proliferation. A differentially expressed gene set between engrafting and nonengrafting patients could identify patients harboring EGFR-mutant tumor with significantly different prognoses in The Cancer Genome Atlas Lung Adenocarcinoma datasets. The PDXs included models with variable sensitivity to first- and second-generation EGFR TKIs and the monoclonal antibody cetuximab. All EGFR-mutant NSCLC PDXs studied closely recapitulated their corresponding patient tumor phenotype and clinical course, including response pattern to EGFR TKIs.PDX models closely recapitulate primary tumor biology and clinical outcome. They may serve as important laboratory models to investigate mechanisms of resistance to targeted therapies, and for preclinical testing of novel treatment strategies.',\n",
       " 'Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is an aggressive form of breast cancer with poor patient outcomes, highlighting the unmet clinical need for targeted therapies and better model systems. Here, we developed and comprehensively characterized a diverse biobank of normal and breast cancer patient-derived organoids (PDO) with a focus on TNBCs. PDOs recapitulated patient tumor intrinsic properties and a subset of PDOs can be propagated for long-term culture (LT-TNBC). Single cell profiling of PDOs identified cell types and gene candidates affiliated with different aspects of cancer progression. The LT-TNBC organoids exhibit signatures of aggressive MYC-driven, basal-like breast cancers and are largely comprised of luminal progenitor (LP)-like cells. The TNBC LP-like cells are distinct from normal LPs and exhibit hyperactivation of NOTCH and MYC signaling. Overall, this study validates TNBC PDOs as robust models for understanding breast cancer biology and progression, paving the way for personalized medicine and tailored treatment options.A comprehensive analysis of patient-derived organoids of TNBC provides insights into cellular heterogeneity and mechanisms of tumorigenesis at the single-cell level.',\n",
       " 'Based on genomic analysis, 50% of high-grade serous ovarian cancers (HGSC) are predicted to have DNA repair defects. Whether this substantial subset of HGSCs actually have functional repair defects remains unknown. Here, we devise a platform for functional profiling of DNA repair in short-term patient-derived HGSC organoids. We tested 33 organoid cultures derived from 22 patients with HGSC for defects in homologous recombination (HR) and replication fork protection. Regardless of DNA repair gene mutational status, a functional defect in HR in the organoids correlated with PARP inhibitor sensitivity. A functional defect in replication fork protection correlated with carboplatin and CHK1 and ATR inhibitor sensitivity. Our results indicate that a combination of genomic analysis and functional testing of organoids allows for the identification of targetable DNA damage repair defects. Larger numbers of patient-derived organoids must be analyzed to determine whether these assays can reproducibly predict patient response in the clinic.Significance: Patient-derived ovarian tumor organoids grow rapidly and match the tumors from which they are derived, both genetically and functionally. These organoids can be used for DNA repair profiling and therapeutic sensitivity testing and provide a rapid means of assessing targetable defects in the parent tumor, offering more suitable treatment options.

       " 'Although BRCA1-deficient tumors are extremely sensitive to DNA-damaging drugs and poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitors, recurrences do occur and, consequently, resistance to therapy remains a serious clinical problem. To study the underlying mechanisms, we induced therapy resistance in patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models of BRCA1-mutated and BRCA1-methylated triple-negative breast cancer.A cohort of 75 mice carrying BRCA1-deficient breast PDX tumors was treated with cisplatin, melphalan, nimustine, or olaparib, and treatment sensitivity was determined. In tumors that acquired therapy resistance, BRCA1 expression was investigated using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction and immunoblotting. Next-generation sequencing, methylation-specific multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA) and Target Locus Amplification (TLA)-based sequencing were used to determine mechanisms of BRCA1 re-expression in therapy-resistant tumors.BRCA1 protein was not detected in therapy-sensitive tumors but was found in 31 out of 42 resistant cases. Apart from previously described mechanisms involving BRCA1-intragenic deletions and loss of BRCA1 promoter hypermethylation, a novel resistance mechanism was identified in four out of seven BRCA1-methylated PDX tumors that re-expressed BRCA1 but retained BRCA1 promoter hypermethylation. In these tumors, we found de novo gene fusions that placed BRCA1 under the transcriptional control of a heterologous promoter, resulting in re-expression of BRCA1 and acquisition of therapy resistance.In addition to previously described clinically relevant resistance mechanisms in BRCA1-deficient tumors, we describe a novel resistance mechanism in BRCA1-methylated PDX tumors involving de novo rearrangements at the BRCA1 locus, demonstrating that BRCA1-methylated breast cancers may acquire therapy resistance via both epigenetic and genetic mechanisms.',\n",
       " 'Availability of lung cancer models that closely mimic human tumors remains a significant gap in cancer research, as tumor cell lines and mouse models may not recapitulate the spectrum of lung cancer heterogeneity seen in patients. We aimed to establish a patient-derived tumor xenograft (PDX) resource from surgically resected non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Fresh tumor tissue from surgical resection was implanted and grown in the subcutaneous pocket of non-obese severe combined immune deficient (NOD SCID) gamma mice. Subsequent passages were in NOD SCID mice. A subset of matched patient and PDX tumors and non-neoplastic lung tissues were profiled by whole exome sequencing, single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) and methylation arrays, and phosphotyrosine (pY)-proteome by mass spectrometry. The data were compared to published NSCLC datasets of NSCLC primary and cell lines. 127 stable PDXs were established from 441 lung carcinomas representing all major histological subtypes: 52 adenocarcinomas, 62 squamous cell carcinomas, one adeno-squamous carcinoma, five sarcomatoid carcinomas, five large cell neuroendocrine carcinomas, and two small cell lung cancers. Somatic mutations, gene copy number and expression profiles, and pY-proteome landscape of 36 PDXs showed greater similarity with patient tumors than with established cell lines. Novel somatic mutations on cancer associated genes were identified but only in PDXs, likely due to selective clonal growth in the PDXs that allows detection of these low allelic frequency mutations. The results provide the strongest evidence yet that PDXs established from lung cancers closely mimic the characteristics of patient primary tumors.',\n",
       " \"Resistance to endocrine treatments and CDK4/6 inhibitors is considered a near-inevitability in most patients with estrogen receptor positive breast cancers (ER‚Äâ+‚ÄâBC). By genomic and metabolomics analyses of patients' tumours, metastasis-derived patient-derived xenografts (PDX) and isogenic cell lines we demonstrate that a fraction of metastatic ER‚Äâ+‚ÄâBC is highly reliant on oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS). Treatment by the OXPHOS inhibitor IACS-010759 strongly inhibits tumour growth in multiple endocrine and palbociclib resistant PDX. Mutations in the PIK3CA/AKT1 genes are significantly associated with response to IACS-010759. At the metabolic level, in vivo response to IACS-010759 is associated with decreased levels of metabolites of the glutathione, glycogen and pentose phosphate pathways in treated tumours. In vitro, endocrine and palbociclib resistant cells show increased OXPHOS dependency and increased ROS levels upon IACS-010759 treatment. Finally, in ER‚Äâ+‚ÄâBC patients, high expression of OXPHOS associated genes predict poor prognosis. In conclusion, these results identify OXPHOS as a promising target for treatment resistant ER‚Äâ+‚ÄâBC patients.\",\n",
       " 'Predicting the clinical response to chemotherapeutic or targeted treatment in patients with locally advanced or metastatic lung cancer requires an accurate and affordable tool. Tumor organoids are a potential approach in precision medicine for predicting the clinical response to treatment. However, their clinical application in lung cancer has rarely been reported because of the difficulty in generating pure tumor organoids. In this study, we have generated 214 cancer organoids from 107 patients, of which 212 are lung cancer organoids (LCOs), primarily derived from malignant serous effusions. LCO-based drug sensitivity tests (LCO-DSTs) for chemotherapy and targeted therapy have been performed in a real-world study to predict the clinical response to the respective treatment. LCO-DSTs accurately predict the clinical response to treatment in this cohort of patients with advanced lung cancer. In conclusion, LCO-DST is a promising precision medicine tool in treating of advanced lung cancer.',\n",
       " 'Trastuzumab-emtansine (T-DM1) is an antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) approved for the treatment of HER2 (human epidermal growth factor receptor 2)-positive breast cancer. T-DM1 consists of trastuzumab covalently linked to the cytotoxic maytansinoid DM1 via a non-cleavable linker. Despite its efficacy, primary or acquired resistance frequently develops, particularly in advanced stages of the disease. Second generation ADCs targeting HER2 are meant to supersede T-DM1 by using a cleavable linker and a more potent payload with a different mechanism of action. To determine the effect of one of these novel ADCs, SYD985, on tumors resistant to T-DM1, we developed several patient-derived models of resistance to T-DM1. Characterization of these models showed that previously described mechanisms-HER2 downmodulation, impairment of lysosomal function and upregulation of drug efflux pumps-account for the resistances observed, arguing that mechanisms of resistance to T-DM1 are limited, and most of them have already been described. Importantly, SYD985 was effective in these models, showing that the resistance to first generation ADCs can be overcome with an improved design.',\n",
       " 'Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) represents 10% of all breast cancers and is a very heterogeneous disease. Globally, women with TNBC have a poor prognosis, and the development of effective targeted therapies remains a real challenge. Patient-derived xenografts (PDX) are clinically relevant models that have emerged as important tools for the analysis of drug activity and predictive biomarker discovery. The purpose of this work was to analyze the molecular heterogeneity of a large panel of TNBC PDX (n‚Äâ=‚Äâ61) in order to test targeted therapies and identify biomarkers of response. At the gene expression level, TNBC PDX represent all of the various TNBC subtypes identified by the Lehmann classification except for immunomodulatory subtype, which is underrepresented in PDX. NGS and copy number data showed a similar diversity of significantly mutated gene and somatic copy number alteration in PDX and the Cancer Genome Atlas TNBC patients. The genes most commonly altered were TP53 and oncogenes and tumor suppressors of the PI3K/AKT/mTOR and MAPK pathways. PDX showed similar morphology and immunohistochemistry markers to those of the original tumors. Efficacy experiments with PI3K and MAPK inhibitor monotherapy or combination therapy showed an antitumor activity in PDX carrying genomic mutations of PIK3CA and NRAS genes. TNBC PDX reproduce the molecular heterogeneity of TNBC patients. This large collection of PDX is a clinically relevant platform for drug testing, biomarker discovery and translational research.',\n",
       " 'Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is a highly heterogeneous cancer lacking actionable targets. Using a phenotypic screen of TNBC cells, we discovered a novel multiple kinase inhibitor tinengotinib (TT-00420) that strongly inhibited Aurora A/B, FGFR1/2/3, VEGFRs, JAK1/2, and CSF1R in biochemical assays. Exposure to tinengotinib specifically inhibited proliferation across all subtypes of TNBC in vitro and in vivo, while leaving luminal breast cancer cells intact. Incubation of HCC1806 with tinengotinib led to dose-dependent downregulation of genes essential for TNBC cell growth and proliferation. Studies revealed that the potential mechanism of action of tinengotinib involved, predominantly, inhibition of Aurora A or B kinase activity, while inhibition of other pathways contributed to suppression of potency and activity. In vitro treatment of TNBC cell lines or in vivo administration in a syngeneic model with tinengotinib resulted in up-regulation of CXCL10 and 11 or diminished tumor-associated macrophage (TAM) infiltration. Tinengotinib represents a novel combinatorial inhibitory mechanism to treat TNBC. The phase I trial of tinengotinib was completed (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT03654547).']"
